NAME: PWE-7: Mismatch of object's fetched interpretation

DESCRIPTION:

This weakness is closely related to CWE-843: Type confusion. In unsafe
languages where there is no type safety, a different type can be cast into
another type. A mismatch in object type in a parser can lead to a cascade
of parsing failures. For this weakness, we additionally want to call
attention to externally fetched APIs that are commonly trusted. Data
formats are not self-contained and may contain child elements that require
separate libraries, files, or network for retrieval. Fetching from a
third-party library can result in misinterpretation of the actual type
compared to the expectant type. This can be difficult to identify when data
flows through a chain of different parsers.
