SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: Improper input validation for presented social media links

DESCRIPTION:

When webapp or website allows for users to add in Profile Settings own
social media links and it is displayed with proper icon for each social
media link - should be validated. In case where GitHub icon is displayed on
user profile - should be validated for real GitHub handle
(https://www.github.com/, https://github.com/ and so on), should not be
allowed to enter other content like http://evilsite.com, because profile
visitors want to see valid, real user external profile, not malicious site.
Other example - if visitor see Twitter icon - link should be proper
validated. In other way it leads to type of Clickjacking (UI redressing) -
user see presented by webapp/website social media icon - during click want
to see real content, should not see not-related site.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This submission is focused on validation of very low-level
concepts such as social media links and user profiles. It may be more
appropriate as a demonstrative example and/or supporting text for
CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input, instead of
a new weakness. (CWE-1288 is a child of CWE-20).  Please let us know
if you agree or disagree with this assessment.

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission might overlap ES2302-f091f80c (CDR #65),
although that submission's weakness is unclear as of June 24, 2025.
This submission emphasizes validation for other user-related
fields. As a result, these two submissions might be combined into a
single CWE, or used as examples in the same CWE.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: Please provide actual references the real-world examples of this
issue and a reference highlighting the issue in more details.
