NAME: Improper input validation for presented social media links

DESCRIPTION:

When webapp or website allows for users to add in Profile Settings own
social media links and it is displayed with proper icon for each social
media link - should be validated. In case where GitHub icon is displayed on
user profile - should be validated for real GitHub handle
(https://www.github.com/, https://github.com/ and so on), should not be
allowed to enter other content like http://evilsite.com, because profile
visitors want to see valid, real user external profile, not malicious site.
Other example - if visitor see Twitter icon - link should be proper
validated. In other way it leads to type of Clickjacking (UI redressing) -
user see presented by webapp/website social media icon - during click want
to see real content, should not see not-related site.
