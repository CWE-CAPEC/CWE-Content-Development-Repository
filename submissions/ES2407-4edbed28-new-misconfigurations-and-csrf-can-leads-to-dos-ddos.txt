NAME: Misconfigurations and CSRF can leads to DoS/DDoS

DESCRIPTION:

Many requests because of error ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (about x50 requests
per single payload/visit) linked in with CSRF (ie.: automated GET using img
- that means no user interaction) can leads to DoS/DDoS.
Example: User visit the vulnerable site and spot the ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
(single visit/request triggered automated 50 requests without user's
knowledge). In combination with CSRF the threat is bigger.
If bad actor will use payload similar like mentioned (ie.: at vulnerable or
malicious sites) with many visitors - victims (visitors) will make requests
without their knowledge. If site has x10/100,000 visitors (in the
approximate time) - the final requests nr will strongly increasing
(multiplication).
In my opinion, it would be good to investigate this security issue.

Encountering the 'ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS' error on a site indicates that
the browser is stuck in an infinite redirection loop. This problem can
arise from various misconfigurations and potential security issues. Let's
break down the possible causes, security threats, and implications.

Causes of 'ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS' Error:
Misconfigured Redirects: Incorrect configuration in server settings, such
as .htaccess files, web server settings (Apache, Nginx), or application
code, leading to a redirection loop.
Improper SSL/TLS Configuration: Redirect loops can occur when HTTP is
incorrectly redirected to HTTPS, or vice versa, in an endless loop.
Third-party Services: Issues with CDN (Content Delivery Network), load
balancers, or proxy servers can also cause redirect loops.
Cookies: Some sites use cookies to manage redirects, and incorrect handling
or corruption of these cookies can result in a loop.

Security Issues and Threats:
1. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Threats
Resource Exhaustion: Attackers could exploit redirect loops to cause
excessive resource usage on the server, leading to a DoS or DDoS situation.
Each redirection request consumes server resources, potentially
overwhelming the server.
Amplification Attack: If multiple clients are redirected continuously, it
can amplify the server load significantly, leading to a DDoS attack.
2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF with GET Requests: If a site is vulnerable to CSRF and uses GET
requests to perform state-changing operations (which is bad practice), an
attacker could cause a client to follow a redirection loop by sending a
maliciously crafted URL. However, modern CSRF protections often require the
use of tokens, which mitigate this risk.
Combined Threats: A CSRF vulnerability could be used in conjunction with
the redirect loop to force a user into an unintended loop, potentially
leading to resource exhaustion on the client side and deteriorating the
user experience.
3. Client-Side Impact
Denial of Access: Clients will be unable to access the site, leading to
frustration and potentially driving users away.
Browser Crashes: Continuous redirects can cause browser instability or
crashes, further impacting the user's experience.

Implications:
1. Loss of Reputation
User Frustration: Users who encounter redirect loops are likely to view the
site as unreliable or poorly maintained.
Search Engine Rankings: Search engines might penalize the site in their
rankings due to poor user experience and frequent errors, leading to
reduced visibility.
2. Security Perception
Trust Issues: Persistent errors can erode trust in the site's security,
making users hesitant to interact with it or enter sensitive information.
Possible Exploits: Users and security analysts might suspect underlying
security issues, such as potential vulnerabilities being exploited.

Mitigation Strategies:
Proper Configuration: Ensure redirects are correctly configured and tested
to prevent loops. Regular audits and automated tests can help identify and
fix issues early.
SSL/TLS Handling: Ensure HTTPS redirection is properly configured and
tested. Tools and services that validate SSL/TLS setups can help identify
misconfigurations.
Robust CSRF Protection: Implement CSRF tokens and ensure state-changing
operations use POST requests with proper validation.
Monitoring and Logging: Use monitoring tools to detect unusual patterns in
redirect behavior and server load, which can indicate potential DoS/DDoS
attempts.
User Communication: Provide clear error messages and potential solutions to
users encountering redirect issues, such as clearing cookies or contacting
support.

In summary, 'ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS' can be a symptom of various
configuration and security issues. Proper diagnosis and mitigation are
essential to maintaining site availability, performance, and security.
