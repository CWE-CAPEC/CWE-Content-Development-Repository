NAME: Modify CWE-598 to add OWASP Reference

DESCRIPTION:

Subject: 
Suggestion: Add OWASP reference to CWE-598 (Use of GET Request Method With
Sensitive Query Strings) and explanation about sensitive information

Dear CWE team,

I would like to suggest adding an OWASP community reference to CWE-598:

OWASP: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in URL -
https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url

This OWASP page is well-structured, widely cited, and illustrates the risks
of sensitive information exposure in URL query strings (history, logs,
referer headers, third-party trackers). Linking it in CWE-598 References
would provide additional practical guidance for developers and security
reviewers.

Additionally, it may be useful to clarify the scope of "sensitive
information" in CWE-598. For example:

Proposed wording:
u201cSensitive information includes secrets such as session identifiers,
passwords, access tokens, API keys, and also Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) such as email addresses or phone numbers. In many
systems, email addresses are both confidential PII and serve as login
identifiers, making their disclosure in query strings a combined privacy
and authentication risk.u201d

Best regards,
Michal Biesiada
