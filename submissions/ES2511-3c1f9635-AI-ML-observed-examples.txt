NAME: Add observed examples for AI products

DESCRIPTION:

This submission will be used to focus the identification, review, and
addition of observed examples based on a report of recent CVEs in
AI/ML-related products. Contributors may make suggestions using comments in
the CDR issue itself.

The task is roughly:

- for each CWE, review the list and identify one to three observed examples
that could be most suitable to include in the CWE entry

The best examples satisfy the following criteria:

  - the vulnerability is not unnecessarily complex

  - the CVE has useful technical details that explain the weakness, whether
in the CVE description itself or in its references (many CVEs do not have
such details)

  - the relevant CWE mapping needs to be verified (in case of errors); a
better CWE can be used if found.

  - ideally, the collected set of CVEs for a particular CWE should reflect
a variety of products, technologies, and/or errors.
