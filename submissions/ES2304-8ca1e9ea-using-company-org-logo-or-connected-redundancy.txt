NAME: Using company/org logo or connected with them items in redundancy situations

DESCRIPTION:

From time to time some orgs/companies are using logo or connected with them
items in redundancy situations which can provide to unwanted actions like
be an 'authorized' by them for bad actors (illegal actions). Example:
company as an added feature let to all users make a QR code for site or
something else with logo company or company connected - feature should just
make a QR code which works correct (from user point of view and usability),
but adding a company's logo by default can be read as redundant and
unwanted action, because they don't know how users (so also bad actors)
will exploit this feature. In short words bad actors can exploits that QR
code with company's logo in really easy way - some victims will be remember
the malicious results with company's logo. There can be many examples of
redundant adding of org/company connected items - exploiting of
bussiness/marketing logic where intentions of some feature were good, but
possibility of exploits by bad actors are large.
