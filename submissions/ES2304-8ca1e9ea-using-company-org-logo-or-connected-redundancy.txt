NAME: Using company/org logo or connected with them items in redundancy situations

DESCRIPTION:

From time to time some orgs/companies are using logo or connected with them
items in redundancy situations which can provide to unwanted actions like
be an 'authorized' by them for bad actors (illegal actions). Example:
company as an added feature let to all users make a QR code for site or
something else with logo company or company connected - feature should just
make a QR code which works correct (from user point of view and usability),
but adding a company's logo by default can be read as redundant and
unwanted action, because they don't know how users (so also bad actors)
will exploit this feature. In short words bad actors can exploits that QR
code with company's logo in really easy way - some victims will be remember
the malicious results with company's logo. There can be many examples of
redundant adding of org/company connected items - exploiting of
bussiness/marketing logic where intentions of some feature were good, but
possibility of exploits by bad actors are large.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The provided submission does not appear to highlight a weakness that falls 
within the scope of the CWE. It describes a general scenario where QR codes 
can be misused, but this does not constitute a technical weakness that 
application developers or maintainers can directly address or control. 
As such, we are unable to proceed with this submission. If you disagree, 
please provide additional details or justification explaining why this 
issue should be considered a technical security focused weakness.

Response: In my opinion, the topic is an interesting one - there is
clearly something that "doesn’t fit quite right" here.

It represents an unnecessary attack vector or an avoidable opportunity for
misuse. To clearly describe the issue, with your permission, I would like
to focus on a single example (although similar cases may occur elsewhere,
across different products - the common aspects being software security +
possibility of misuse of the feature + perhaps not fully secure
design/approach). My goal is to illustrate the idea and highlight how this
could help promote a more secure approach to the discussed topic. I hope
the example below will help clarify the concern I intended to share with
the community.

Illustrative example - potential risk: Depending on which browser is used,
a user can often access a feature via RMB -> "Create QR code for this
page."

The purpose of this feature is to generate and display a correct QR code -
that's its intended, legitimate use. However, some browsers automatically
add their logo or branding element to the generated QR code, most likely
for marketing or recognition purposes.

While this is fine in benign use cases, the situation changes when a
malicious actor takes advantage of it - e.g., generating a QR code that
leads to malicious content. The difference is that the browser's logo,
added by default, unintentionally lends trust and credibility to the QR
code.

Of course, a malicious actor could add such branding manually, but in this
case, it's automatic and default behavior, which lowers the effort
threshold for abuse. In my view, since the resulting QR code's destination
or intent is not verified or controlled, it would be safer to avoid adding
organizational branding by default, to prevent potential misuse and
reputational risk.

The QR code scenario is just an example meant to illustrate a broader
point: similar concerns could appear in other, non-QR-related contexts -
particularly where secure-by-design principles should apply. In that sense,
I believe it's a topic worth consideration.

In a slightly different context, this could resemble a kind of "server-side
spoofing", where an external actor can influence a generated output,
affecting security indirectly. However, in this case, the issue relates
more to the software's design and behavior than to web mechanisms
themselves.

I'd be happy to clarify further if needed, and I'm genuinely interested in
your thoughts on this topic.

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The references provided describe attack types that differ from 
the issue outlined in your summary. If you believe this submission should 
be included in the CWE, please provide references that directly support and 
align with your proposed weakness.

Response: Thank you for your comments. I believe the issue could be
unlocked if it passes the SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness" phase. If
the topic is deemed not relevant to CWE, the issue will naturally
become obsolete.

Since around 2023, I've been planning to write an article on this subject -
regardless of whether it eventually fits as a CWE entry. It's possible that
someone else may have already addressed this in the meantime; I plan to
research that further.

I'm familiar with both the vendor perspective and the security implications
involved. If there's no objection, we could revisit this topic in the next
round - or, alternatively, simply leave it closed if it doesn't progress to
the next stage.

Thank you once again for your understanding and your time.
