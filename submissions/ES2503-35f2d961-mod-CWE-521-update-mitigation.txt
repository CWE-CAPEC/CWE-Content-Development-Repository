NAME: CWE-521 update password expiration in mitigations

DESCRIPTION:

In the Potential Mitigations element we should remove the section about
Password Expiration. It was a recommended practice in the past, which is
now outdated.

Nowadays, both the NIST and the CESG recommend not updating the same
password periodically:
  - "Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed
arbitrarily (e.g., periodically)" (page 14 of
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf)
 - "Regular password changing harms rather than improves security" (page 6
of
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a806bb9e5274a2e87db9b6a/Password_guidance_-_simplifying_your_approach.pdf)
