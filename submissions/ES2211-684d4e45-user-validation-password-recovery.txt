ACTIVE ISSUES:



SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The actual weakness is not fully apparent based on the given description.  From what we can gather based on
the scenarios and cited reference, the actual weakness is something along the lines of "Use of password recovery mechanism
with unverified email".  The emphasis here is the unverified email.  Please let us know if you think we have captured the
intended weakness or if you see the weakness as being something different.  

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: While this submission does not overlap with an existing weakness, it is important to highlight potential
overlap with exising submissions.  The overlap that we currently see is with 
ES2206-33c5627d-bad-account-creation-logic.txt, ES2206-d46a8c14-lack-of-reporting-in-links-for-account.txt, and 
ES2206-feb8f4c9-non-expiring-links-for-account.txt.  These current submissions are all related to account creation or
modification which includes email addresses.  Further consideration will be needed as these submissions are moved through
the process to avoid duplicate content.
