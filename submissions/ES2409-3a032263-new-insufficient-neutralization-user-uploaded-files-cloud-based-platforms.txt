NAME: Insufficient Neutralization of User-uploaded Files in Cloud-based Platforms

DESCRIPTION:

Cloud service providers are frequently required to employ external
utilities for the handling of files uploaded by users. Unfortunately, these
external utilities may exhibit a deficiency in protective measures against
malicious content within user-uploaded files. This oversight can pave the
way for server compromise through various security breaches such as data
exposure, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incidents, or the execution
of unauthorized code.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The description doesn't provide a clear weakness. 
What is the mistake or insecure design choice that the developer has made 
that allows malicious files to be uploaded? Let us know if you only want 
to add the 2 CVE examples. We would need to determine which CWEs would be
appropriate. 

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: There is no actual reference provided that highlights the need
for covering this weakness. CVEs aren't considered as ideal references for the
purposes of understanding the weakness. Please provide an actual reference
that delves into the weakness more.
