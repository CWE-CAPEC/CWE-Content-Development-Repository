NAME: Insufficient Neutralization of User-uploaded Files in Cloud-based Platforms

DESCRIPTION:

Cloud service providers are frequently required to employ external
utilities for the handling of files uploaded by users. Unfortunately, these
external utilities may exhibit a deficiency in protective measures against
malicious content within user-uploaded files. This oversight can pave the
way for server compromise through various security breaches such as data
exposure, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incidents, or the execution
of unauthorized code.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The description doesn't provide a clear weakness. 
What is the mistake or insecure design choice that the developer has made 
that allows malicious files to be uploaded? Let us know if you only want 
to add the 2 CVE examples. We would need to determine which CWEs would be
appropriate. 

Response: Cloud service providers often rely on external utilities to
process user-uploaded files. Developers incorrectly assume these
utilities inherently sanitize or validate file content, leading to
insufficient neutralization of malicious elements. This trust in
third-party tools without implementing additional safeguards allows
attackers to upload files containing malware, scripts, or exploit
payloads. When processed, these files enable attacks such as
server-side code execution, data breaches, or DDoS via resource
exhaustion (e.g., decompression bombs).

The key point is, that the developer mistake is the failure to enforce
strict validation, sanitization, or sandboxing of user-uploaded files
before passing them to external utilities. This insecure design choice
creates a mismatch between the security expectations of the external
tool and the actual risks posed by unverified input.


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: There is no actual reference provided that highlights the need
for covering this weakness. CVEs aren't considered as ideal references for the
purposes of understanding the weakness. Please provide an actual reference
that delves into the weakness more.

Response: Let me make some explanation for these CVEs:

CVE-2024-44082/OSSA-2024-003: Unvalidated image data passed to
qemu-img Untrusted files were passed into qemu-img. It may trigger
unexpected behaviors, such as unauthorized access to sensitive files.

CVE-2024-40767/OSSA-2024-002: Incomplete file access fix and
regression for QCOW2 backing files and VMDK flat descriptors
Developers persist in utilizing the "qemu-img info" command to
identify malicious inputs, despite explicit warnings from the QEMU
team that "it is dangerous to call qemu-img info on untrusted files".

CVE-2024-32498/OSSA-2024-001: Arbitrary file access through custom
QCOW2 external data Uploading a qcow2 file containing "external data"
will result in qemu-tools accessing the referenced external data. If
such data includes sensitive file paths (e.g., /etc/passwd), this may
lead to potential leakage of sensitive information through the exposed
path references.

CVE-2022-47951/OSSA-2023-002: Arbitrary file access through custom
VMDK flat descriptor Uploading flat VMDK files may cause qemu-tools to
access the "flat image". If this image references a sensitive path
such as /etc/passwd, it could result in potential exposure of
sensitive information.

CVE-2022-47950/OSSA-2023-001: Arbitrary file access through custom S3
XML entities XXE-like vulnerability: Uploading XML files containing
entities may result in the lxml.etree.XMLParser invoked by OpenStack
accessing sensitive files.

CVE-2015-5162/OSSA-2016-012: Malicious qemu-img input may exhaust
resources in Cinder, Glance, Nova Developers persist in utilizing the
"qemu-img info" command to identify malicious inputs, despite explicit
warnings from the QEMU team that "it is dangerous to call qemu-img
info on untrusted files".

CVE-2014-3641/OSSA-2014-033: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm
instance A maliciously crafted qcow2 header can cause the qemu-img
info utility to erroneously identify raw-format disk images as qcow2
format, thereby triggering operational errors in the OpenStack Cinder
component during subsequent processing.
