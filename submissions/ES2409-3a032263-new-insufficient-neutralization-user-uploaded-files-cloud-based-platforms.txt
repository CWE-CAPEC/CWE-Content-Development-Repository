NAME: Insufficient Neutralization of User-uploaded Files in Cloud-based Platforms

DESCRIPTION:

Cloud service providers are frequently required to employ external
utilities for the handling of files uploaded by users. Unfortunately, these
external utilities may exhibit a deficiency in protective measures against
malicious content within user-uploaded files. This oversight can pave the
way for server compromise through various security breaches such as data
exposure, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incidents, or the execution
of unauthorized code.
