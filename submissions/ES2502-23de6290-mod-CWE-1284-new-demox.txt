NAME: CWE-1284 modification new demonstrative example

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code for PHP language for the given
description.

Demonstrative Examples:

````
<?php
$discount = $_POST['discount'];
$originalPrice = 100.00;
$finalPrice = $originalPrice - ($originalPrice * $discount / 100);
processPayment($finalPrice);
?>
````
This PHP code allows users to apply a discount to an item but does not
validate or restrict the discount percentage. An attacker could submit a
100% or even a negative discount value, making the finalPrice zero or
negative. This could result in unauthorized free purchases or even getting
money credited instead of paying.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: This example is reasonable, but we will need to add more
details. In Stage 2, we will work with you to refine this example to
fit with CWE's expected style, such as introductory text and a "good
code" example to demonstrate the fix.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY]
