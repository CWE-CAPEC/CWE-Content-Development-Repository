ACTIVE ISSUES:



SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: While it is clear that there is some weakness present in the
submission, it is unclear what specific weakness is being discussed.
The main term used is "misconfigured", which is very broad and could
have several meanings. Please provide more detail about what weakness
is present when configuring a content security policy.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: With the present information we have about this submission,
it seems to overlap with CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with
Untrusted Domains.  While a content security policy is slightly
different than a Cross-domain Policy, it is possible that if the
"misconfigured" policy discussed in the submission is related being
overly permissive, then it might be best as a modification to CWE-942,
or to create a more general parent.  More details are needed to
determine if this submission is suitable for its own entry adjacent to
CWE-942.

Response: This is not an an overlap of CWE-942 as Content Security Policy
is more prevalent as it applies to every Modern browser & Websites on the
internet, CWE-942 only pertains a very small subset of applications (Flash
and Silver light).


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: While the provided references describe what a content
security policy is and are revelent to the proposed entry, there
should be references that help describe the weakness itself.  For
instance, a reference describing specifically how a content security
policy could be misconfigured would be benificial in supporting a new
entry.

Response: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7762,
https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html



----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: As discussed earlier, because of potential overlaps with
CWE-942 and a lack of specific weakness details, it is uncertain if
this would require a new entry or a modification to CWE-942 until we
have more details.

Response: This should be new entry or at least a modification to CWE-942
as the scope of CSP potentially includes almost all modern browsers and
websites on the internet.
