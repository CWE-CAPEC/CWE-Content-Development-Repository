ACTIVE ISSUES:



SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: While it is clear that there is some weakness present in the submission, it is unclear
what specific weakness is being discussed.  The main term used is "misconfigured", which is very
broad and could have several meanings.  Please provide more detail about what weakness is present
when configuring a content security policy.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: With the present information we have about this submission, it seems to overlap with
CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains.  While a content security policy
is slightly different than a Cross-domain Policy, it is possible that if the "misconfigured" policy
discussed in the submission is related being overly permissive, then it might be best as a modification
to CWE-942.  More details are needed to determine if this submission is suitable for it's own entry 
adjacent to CWE-942.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: While the provided references describe what a content security policy is and are revelent to the 
proposed entry, there should be references that help describe the weakness itself.  For instance, a reference 
describing specifically how a content security policy could be misconfigured would be benificial in supporting
a new entry.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: As discussed eariler, because of potential overlaps with CWE-942 and a lack of specific weakness details,
it is uncertain if this would require a new entry of a modification to CWE-942 until we have more details.
