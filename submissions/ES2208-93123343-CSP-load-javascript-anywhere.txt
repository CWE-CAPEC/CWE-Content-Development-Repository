ACTIVE ISSUES:



RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: While it is clear that there is some weakness present in the
submission, it is unclear what specific weakness is being discussed.
The main term used is "misconfigured", which is very broad and could
have several meanings. Please provide more detail about what weakness
is present when configuring a content security policy.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Submitter provided
additional details in other responses that clarify the problem being
discussed.

---------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: While the provided references describe what a content
security policy is and are revelent to the proposed entry, there
should be references that help describe the weakness itself.  For
instance, a reference describing specifically how a content security
policy could be misconfigured would be benificial in supporting a new
entry.

https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html

----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: The action for this submission has been changed to
"Modification" because CWE-942 will be updated to include details from
this submission.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE]


-------



SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission is intended to be covered by CWE-942:
Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains. However, as
Submitter noted in a 2024-10-29 response, CWE-942's extended
description currently focuses on "a very small subset of applications
(Flash and Silver light)". We will modify CWE-942's extended
description and examples to ensure that "Content Security
Policy... applies to every Modern browser & Websites on the internet."

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IN A LATER PHASE]
This is not an an overlap of CWE-942 as Content Security Policy is
more prevalent as it applies to every Modern browser & Websites on the
internet, CWE-942 only pertains a very small subset of applications
(Flash and Silver light).
