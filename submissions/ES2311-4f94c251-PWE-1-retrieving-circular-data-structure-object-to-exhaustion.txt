NAME: PWE-1: Retrieving circular data structure object to exhaustion

DESCRIPTION:

When parsing data structures, it is possible for data references to go down
a circular logic path in an infinite referencing loop. This error commonly
occurs in cyclic tree type structures. Besides loops, it can also occur in
infinite recursion. A self-referencing object pointer will consume memory
and processor usage until the process is terminated, resulting in a denial
of service. However, if the memory can be controlled, it can lead to the
attacker gaining remote execution. This is the same genre of bugs as
compression bombs, commonly occurring in archive or zip bombs that
decompress a large amount of data in memory, causing memory exhaustion, and
the process to crash. Other uncommon compression formats are also
susceptible: jpeg, png, webp, nitf, etc.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: There is alignment with CWE-409 ("This is the same genre of bugs as
compression bombs, commonly occurring in archive or zip bombs that
decompress a large amount of data in memory") and CWE-835 
("an infinite referencing loop" which is basically CWE-835: Loop with 
Unreachable Exit Condition 'Infinite Loop'). This may mean that this
submission can potentially be brought into one or both of these CWEs. Confirm
if you'd be open to that.

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: "Retrieving circular data structure object" appears to be too 
low-level for a CWE. However, the CWE team thinks that 
"Improper Handling of Circular References" or "Reference Loops" has merit
to be its own CWE. Please confirm if you'd be open to making the CWE
at a higher abstraction than currently provided.
