NAME: PWE-1: Retrieving circular data structure object to exhaustion

DESCRIPTION:

When parsing data structures, it is possible for data references to go down
a circular logic path in an infinite referencing loop. This error commonly
occurs in cyclic tree type structures. Besides loops, it can also occur in
infinite recursion. A self-referencing object pointer will consume memory
and processor usage until the process is terminated, resulting in a denial
of service. However, if the memory can be controlled, it can lead to the
attacker gaining remote execution. This is the same genre of bugs as
compression bombs, commonly occurring in archive or zip bombs that
decompress a large amount of data in memory, causing memory exhaustion, and
the process to crash. Other uncommon compression formats are also
susceptible: jpeg, png, webp, nitf, etc.
