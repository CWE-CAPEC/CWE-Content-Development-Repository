NAME: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting

DESCRIPTION:

Submission Statement.

1. Intended behavior: Large Language Models (LLMs) should distinguish
between system instructions and user-provided chat inputs
2. Weakness: LLMs often confuse user inputs with system instructions,
allowing an attacker to override developer-provided directives in the
system instructions. This can lead to unpredictable behavior in the LLM
outputs. Depending on how the LLM outputs are used by the application, this
could allow the attacker to perform various undesirable operations
involving LLM agents or other system components.
3. Affected resource: Prompt construction process and LLM inference.
4. Affected technology: Large Language Models

I have included a proposed draft of the CWE entry below.

Description.

The product uses externally-provided data to build prompts provided to
large language models (LLMs), but the way these prompts are constructed
causes the LLM to fail to distinguish between user-supplied inputs and
developer provided system directives, impacting the confidentiality,
integrity, and/or availability of the product. 

Extended Description.

When prompts are constructed using externally controllable data, it is
often possible to cause an LLM to ignore the original guidance provided by
its creators (known as the "system prompt") by inserting malicious
instructions in plain human language or using bypasses such as special
characters or tags. Because LLMs are designed to treat all instructions as
legitimate, there is often no way for the model to differentiate between
what prompt language is malicious when it performs inference and returns
data. Many LLM systems incorporate data from other adjacent products or
external data sources like Wikipedia using API calls and retrieval
augmented generation (RAG). Any external sources in use that may contain
untrusted data should also be considered potentially malicious.

ACTIVE ISSUES:



RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The submission suggests this should be a child of CWE-94,
but CWE-77 (command injection) is probably more appropriate. Please
note if you agree with this decision. This will not prevent movement
to the next phase.

Response: We agree that CWE-77 is a fitting parent CWE for our submission - 
we were between CWE-77 and CWE-94 originally, so this is no surprise.

----------

SUB.COORD - "Requires extensive coordination"

Description: The submission will require or is currently undergoing close
coordination, discussion, and debate between multiple parties with
different perspectives and opinions.  The communication could be taking
place in CDR itself, or outside of CDR.  As a result, it might take longer
to move the submission to later phases, although the submission is expected
to be more robust and well-defined as a result of this coordination.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient consensus has been reached, or if
the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.

Comments: This submission is planned to undergo active review and
development within the CWE AI Working Group. Please acknowledge this
note.

Response: Acknowledged!


----------

SUB.NEWTECH - "New/Emerging Technology"

Description: The submission is related to a new or emerging technology that
is not well-understood from a weakness perspective, which can cause real or
perceived gaps in CWE that require extra effort and time to analyze.
Typically, for new/emerging technologies, early vulnerability discovery and
research does not focus on root cause analysis (i.e., weakness
identification). Instead, the focus is on other areas such as attacks and
exploitation methods, technical impacts, threats, mitigations, or other
concerns.  As a result, industry understanding can be limited, effectively
requiring research or focused efforts by SMEs to understand the underlying
weaknesses.  Rapidly-changing, diverse terminology and technology can
further complicate understanding. Finally, there might not be enough
real-world examples with sufficient details from which weakness patterns
may be discovered.  For this reason, it can be difficult to determine
whether CWE entries already cover the topics of concern, and which gaps (if
any) exist.  As of May 2024, some new or emerging technologies include
AI/ML, cryptocurrency/blockchain, post-quantum cryptography, and
large-scale architectures with many components that have different trust
boundaries.  In previous years, new/emerging domains for CWE included
hardware, cloud, and ICS/OT.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient attempts have been made to
understand the weaknesses commonly seen in new or emerging technologies, or
if the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.  Analysis
could include analyzing well-known attacks to understand the weaknesses
that enable the attacks to succeed; analysis of mitigations to understand
how the underlying weaknesses are perceived; and/or other methods.  Such
analysis might require consultation with a variety of Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs).

Comments: Since AI/ML weakness classification is new and the focus has
been on attacks on mitigations, typically there can be complications
during analysis. However, this submission is in close alignment with
work by CWE Team members and AI WG members in the past few months, so
problems are not anticipated. Please acknowledge that you have seen
this comment.

Response: Acknowledged!
