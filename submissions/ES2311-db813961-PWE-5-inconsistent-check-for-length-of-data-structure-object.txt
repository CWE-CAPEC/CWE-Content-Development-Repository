NAME: PWE-5: Inconsistent check for length of data structure object

DESCRIPTION:

Parsers fail to calculate large or unusual sizes, or compensate with
complex logic handling. This published weakness is a cause of frequent
security bugs with length over/under-run vulnerabilities. We re-define the
problem in terms of parsing and parsers to narrow the scope and focus. When
modeling data formats, length is critical in all data structure objects to
build a trusted sequence of data objects.
