NAME: PWE-5: Inconsistent check for length of data structure object

DESCRIPTION:

Parsers fail to calculate large or unusual sizes, or compensate with
complex logic handling. This published weakness is a cause of frequent
security bugs with length over/under-run vulnerabilities. We re-define the
problem in terms of parsing and parsers to narrow the scope and focus. When
modeling data formats, length is critical in all data structure objects to
build a trusted sequence of data objects.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   Other CWE-805
   Other CWE-130

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The proposed entry is very similar to CWE-130. The main difference
lies in the fact that the proposed entry narrows the scope by focusing only
on the parsers. This will lead to a modification in CWE-130. We will likely
highlight your proposed submission as one of the observed examples or 
under mitigations. Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: This submission doesn't warrant a new CWE, as we already have
CWE-130 that covers the topic being proposed. We will certainly incorporate
what is proposed in this submission within CWE-130 to enhance it's coverage.
Please let us know if you are okay with that.
