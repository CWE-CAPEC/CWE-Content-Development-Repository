NAME: Unverified Email Change

DESCRIPTION:

Similar like for CWE-620: Unverified Password Change - email address is a
part of credentials, as login part (email address and password - Login
form) or main part for Reset/Forgot password feature. Email Change action
should be protected by typing current password or similar method - proofing
that person is a real user, account owner. Otherwise it can lead to ATO
account takeover.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: Considering the connection with CWE-620 and the unique alterations
possible with the proposed entry, it is incumbent upon the CWE team to determine
the best approach to handle this proposal. This situation presents an
opportunity for CWE-620 to evolve into a higher-level CWE, encompassing both
email and password. Alternatively, a new CWE could be established specifically
for Unverified Email Change. Further discussion is necessary to establish the
most effective course of action. There is also a potential overlap with another
proposed entry (See "ES2206-33c5627d - Account management with insufficient
verification of owner's external identifier(s)"). Relationships between these
entries would need to be carefully considered. Please indicate if you agree or
disagree with this comment.

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The submission lacks any references that demonstrate the real-world
applicability of this issue. The author should incorporate actual examples,
complete with references, to illustrate how this issue has been exploited in
real-world scenarios. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this
comment.

----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that should be fixed before publication.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
be published without grammar and spelling checks. American English is used
for spelling.

Comments:  The existing description does not adhere to the standard rules of
American English grammar and style. Here's a proposed revision for enhanced
clarity and correctness. "In a similar vein to CWE-620: Unverified Password
Change, an email address serves as a crucial part of the credentials. It is used
either in the login process (alongside the password in the Login form) or as the
primary component for the Reset/Forgot password feature. The action of changing
the email should be secured by requiring the input of the current password or a
comparable method, thereby verifying the identity of the actual user or account
owner. Failure to implement such security measures could potentially result in
an Account Takeover." Please indicate if you agree or disagree with the proposed
suggestion.

----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: Due to other submission problems we are unsure which action to take at
this time. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this comment.
