NAME: Unverified Email Change

DESCRIPTION:

In a similar vein to CWE-620: Unverified Password Change, an email
address serves as a crucial part of the credentials. It is used either
in the login process (alongside the password in the Login form) or as
the primary component for the Reset/Forgot password feature. The
action of changing the email should be secured by requiring the input
of the current password or a comparable method, thereby verifying the
identity of the actual user or account owner. Failure to implement
such security measures could potentially result in an Account
Takeover.

A quick comment as part of the discussion — Please note that the email
change function is usually tied to security, as it either pertains to
login (email and password) or is used for password recovery (sending
reset links to the email address).

Otherwise, why introduce an email change function at all? Consider a
hypothetical scenario where the email address does not serve these
purposes and can be changed without verifying "I am who I claim to
be." In such a situation, an attacker might not take over the account
but could gain access to sensitive information if the product sends
notifications to the changed email address.

In other scenarios not covered here, the email change function itself
would be pointless — after all, why add an email change function if
the product does not send notifications to that address or if it is
not used for login or account recovery?

This underscores how important and critical this topic is — ensuring
proper safeguards for performing this action.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: Considering the connection with CWE-620 and the unique alterations
possible with the proposed entry, it is incumbent upon the CWE team to determine
the best approach to handle this proposal. This situation presents an
opportunity for CWE-620 to evolve into a higher-level CWE, encompassing both
email and password. Alternatively, a new CWE could be established specifically
for Unverified Email Change. Further discussion is necessary to establish the
most effective course of action. There is also a potential overlap with another
proposed entry (See "ES2206-33c5627d - Account management with insufficient
verification of owner's external identifier(s)"). Relationships between these
entries would need to be carefully considered. Please indicate if you agree or
disagree with this comment.

Response: Agree - please take your time, don't be in hurry.

For me entry 'ES2206-33c5627d' looks interesting, but it's separate
topic in my opinion. Not connected, not overlapped.

Based on my observations, email is currently the most common method
for Reset/Password Recovery functions (as there isn’t another way that
is equally convenient and secure). While we require a password change
to be preceded by entering the current password (to confirm "I am who
I claim to be"), the same should apply to the email address. An
attacker could use an unsecured email change process to take over an
account (reset the password and before this action, assign a new
malicious email address) if proper safeguards are not in place (to
confirm "I am who I claim to be").

----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: Due to other submission problems we are unsure which action to take at
this time. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: I have just sent the answers to the bullet points, I hope it
will be useful.


----------

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that should be fixed before publication.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
be published without grammar and spelling checks. American English is used
for spelling.

Comments:  The existing description does not adhere to the standard rules of
American English grammar and style. Here's a proposed revision for enhanced
clarity and correctness. "In a similar vein to CWE-620: Unverified Password
Change, an email address serves as a crucial part of the credentials. It is used
either in the login process (alongside the password in the Login form) or as the
primary component for the Reset/Forgot password feature. The action of changing
the email should be secured by requiring the input of the current password or a
comparable method, thereby verifying the identity of the actual user or account
owner. Failure to implement such security measures could potentially result in
an Account Takeover." Please indicate if you agree or disagree with the proposed
suggestion.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Agree. Sorry for that and
thank you very much. Looks correct and professional.

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The submission lacks any references that demonstrate the real-world
applicability of this issue. The author should incorporate actual examples,
complete with references, to illustrate how this issue has been exploited in
real-world scenarios. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this
comment.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Submitter provided multiple
references that have been added to REFERENCES.
