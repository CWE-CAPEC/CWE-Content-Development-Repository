NAME: CWE-94 modification fix demonstrative example

DESCRIPTION:

Hello CWE Content Team,

Your weakness definition page for CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of
Code ('Code Injection') contains an error in the Python documentation.

Example 3 demonstrates a u201csimple scriptu201d in the Python language
which u201casks a user to supply a list of numbers as input and adds them
together.u201d The purpose is to showcase improper use of the `eval`
built-in.

The unsafe code example taken from that page reads:

```
def main():
  sum = 0
  numbers = eval(input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: "))
  for num in numbers:
    sum = sum + num
  print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
main()

```

Running this program will prompt the user for a space-separated list of
numbers. If the user supplies the space-separated list of numbers as
requested, Python will throw a syntax error. For the compliant user who
follows the programu2019s instructions perfectly, the script will crash.

A more realistic unsafe usage of `eval` would not crash on expected inputs.
Such a working script would ask the user for a comma-separated list of
numbers instead of spaces. Here is an example program in that vein:

```
def main():
  sum = 0
  numbers = eval(input("Enter a comma-separated list of numbers: "))
  for num in numbers:
    sum = sum + num
  print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
main()

```

The new program gives the user a different message instructing them what to
enter. A user who follows these instructions will cause an iterable to be
assigned to the variable `numbers`, and the program will avoid the crash. 

The sentence immediately following the code block on this page mentions
u201clist comprehension methods,u201d indicating that the unsafe programmer
was trying to produce a list. For this piece of the documentation to stay
accurate, the unsafe code block should try to produce a list when eval is
run on the input instead of a tuple, as above. For example:

```
def main():
  sum = 0
  numbers = eval(f"[{input('Enter a comma-separated list of numbers: ')}]")
  for num in numbers:
    sum = sum + num
  print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
main()

```
The square brackets needed for the comma-separated values to be read as a
list are supplied by the programmer.

There can be no temptation to directly evaluate a space-separated list of
numbers in Python, which will not evaluate. In either of the above working
examples, the sanitized version of the code example should also ask for a
comma-separated list then split the user-supplied string on the comma
character (rather than on the space character, as it would for a
space-separated list).

A corresponding, improved version of the sanitized script could read as
follows:

```
def main():
  sum = 0
  numbers = input("Enter a comma-separated list of numbers: ").split(",")
  try:
    for num in numbers:
      sum = sum + int(num)
    print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
  except ValueError:
    print("Error: invalid input")
main()

```

These changes to the unsafe Python example and to the sanitized Python
example can better clarify the dangers of running `eval` on user-supplied
input.



All the best,
Matthew A. Pagan

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: Thank you.  We agree that the bad code snippet produces a
SyntaxError.  The issue is that python3's "eval" does not evaluate a
space separated string of numbers as a list like the snippet expects
it to.  Instead, python3 is set to translate a comma separated list of
numbers expressed as a string into a list. We will modify the good
code as you suggested, and make small changes to the original bad code
to try/catch any potential SyntaxError, which will still allow the
malicious eval().

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY; MODIFICATION TO BE MADE PER SUGGESTION]
