NAME: Modify CWE-1268 to fix demox

DESCRIPTION:

 Typo in the Example 1 section of  CWE-1268   as described on page 
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1268.html

The paragraph currently is:
 ---
Now, recall Agent 3 is untrusted. As explained above, the value of the
AES_KEY_CONTROL_POLICY register gives agent 3 access to write to the
AES_KEY_WRITE_POLICY register. Agent 3 can use this write access to add
themselves to the AES_KEY_WRITE_POLICY register. 

This is accomplished by Agent 3 writing the value 0x00000006. In binary,
the lower 8 bits are 0000 0110, meaning that bit 3 will be set.
 
Thus, giving Agent 3, having the ability to write to the AES Key registers.

It should be:
---
This is accomplished by Agent 3 writing the value 0x0000000A. In binary,
the lower 8 bits are 0000 1010, meaning that bit 3 will be set.
