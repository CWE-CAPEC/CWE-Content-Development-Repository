NAME: Modify CWE-1268 to fix demox

DESCRIPTION:

 Typo in the Example 1 section of  CWE-1268   as described on page 
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1268.html

The paragraph currently is:
 ---
Now, recall Agent 3 is untrusted. As explained above, the value of the
AES_KEY_CONTROL_POLICY register gives agent 3 access to write to the
AES_KEY_WRITE_POLICY register. Agent 3 can use this write access to add
themselves to the AES_KEY_WRITE_POLICY register. 

This is accomplished by Agent 3 writing the value 0x00000006. In binary,
the lower 8 bits are 0000 0110, meaning that bit 3 will be set.
 
Thus, giving Agent 3, having the ability to write to the AES Key registers.
---

It should be:
---
This is accomplished by Agent 3 writing the value 0x0000000A. In binary,
the lower 8 bits are 0000 1010, meaning that bit 3 will be set.

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: We agree that 0x00000006 is an incorrect value for Agent 3
to write to the AES_KEY_WRITE_POLICY register.  Somehow this was
changed from the value that was used in the original version of the
demonstrative example, 0x0000000C. We believe that 0x0000000C is more
appropriate than the suggested 0x0000000A.

- 0x0A = 0000 1010b sets bits 1 and 3, enabling Agents 1 and 3, and
  clearing bit 2 (so Agent 2 would lose write access). The "configured
  access control policy" table indicates that Agent 2 is the default
  agent for write access. The policy does not mention anything about
  Agent 1 and write access.

- To keep the default Agent 2 (bit 2) and add Agent 3 (bit 3), use
  0x0000000C = 0000 1100b (bits 2 and 3 set).

This change would keep existing functionality without removing Agent
2's write access. Removing Agent 2's write access would likely cause
operational problems that could expose the attack. We will adjust the
example's commentary to mention that the attacker could provide other
values that could cause a denial of service to existing authorized
Agents.

Please let us know if you agree with this proposal.
