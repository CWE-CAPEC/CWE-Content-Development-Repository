NAME: CWE-464 demox doesn't compile

DESCRIPTION:

I discussed Example 1 with a friend and as given it won't even compile. A
semicolon is missing after foo[4]='\0', but more importantly atoi expects a
char* while getc provides a char. If you use foo[2]=0; directly, the second
statement demonstrates the early null termination as intended.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: We agree with the finding. 1) The code doesn't compile as
getc(stdin) and atoi have a type mismatch. atoi() expects a string
(char pointer), but getc() returns an integer. 2) The submitter is
also correct about missing ";" after "foo[4]='\0'". The proposed
suggestion "foo[2]=0;" doesn't work as the input needs to come in from
a user. We will need to adjust the code.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IN A LATER PHASE]
