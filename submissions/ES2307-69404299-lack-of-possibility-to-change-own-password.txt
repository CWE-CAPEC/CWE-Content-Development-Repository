NAME: Lack of possibility to change own password

DESCRIPTION:

Applications should allow users (account owner) to change their own
passwords.  This is important in cases like data compromised, where
user's reaction/action should be quick and user should have
opportunity to change own password (account protection).

Useful resource:
https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#Implement-Proper-Password-Strength-Controls

"Ensure credential rotation when a password leak occurs, or at the
time of compromise identification." - here, it is a part of
credentials.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SCOPE.NOTREAL - "Not a real-world issue"

Description: The issue has not happened and cannot occur in real-world
software or other electronic logic, and/or has no actual security
implications.

Resolution: As of January 2023, the submission will be rejected or delayed
pending close review, possibly including community engagement.

Comments: The proposed submission highlights something that might not happen
in real-world situations any more. All applications with sensitive data should offer changing
of passwords periodically. If the submitter is aware of specific examples
that violate this, then those should be included in the submission.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission emphasizes the inability to change a
password, and a separate submission (ES2307-7a0d993a) focuses on
e-mail addresses. These submissions should probably be addressed at
the same time. Please acknowledge this point.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that must be fixed before the Publication stage.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
move to the Publication stage without grammar and spelling checks. American
English is used for spelling.

Comments: We suggest some minor modifications to the description to reflect
American English: "Applications should allow users 
(account owners) to change their own passwords. This is important in cases 
where data may be compromised, since the user's response should be swift, and 
users should have the opportunity to change their password to protect their 
account." Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.
