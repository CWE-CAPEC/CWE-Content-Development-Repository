NAME: Lack of possibility to change own password

DESCRIPTION:

Applications should allow users (account owners) to change their own
passwords. This is important in cases where data may be compromised,
since the user's response should be swift, and users should have the
opportunity to change their password to protect their account.

Useful resource:
https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#Implement-Proper-Password-Strength-Controls

"Ensure credential rotation when a password leak occurs, or at the
time of compromise identification." - here, it is a part of
credentials.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SCOPE.NOTREAL - "Not a real-world issue"

Description: The issue has not happened and cannot occur in real-world
software or other electronic logic, and/or has no actual security
implications.

Resolution: As of January 2023, the submission will be rejected or delayed
pending close review, possibly including community engagement.

Comments: The proposed submission highlights something that might not happen
in real-world situations any more. All applications with sensitive data should offer changing
of passwords periodically. If the submitter is aware of specific examples
that violate this, then those should be included in the submission.

Response: Definitely cannot agree.

"All applications with sensitive data should offer changing of
passwords periodically" - keyword 'should'.  The reality,
unfortunately, is that not all products offer this yet.

Example: https://careers.phenompeople.com/us/en/candidatehub#accountSettings
It was reported to them via proper channel (VDP) almost 2 years ago, and still occurs.

Repro steps:

As logged in user go to
https://careers.phenompeople.com/us/en/myprofile (and click around
there in other tabs, etc) See that you can not change own password

(Login to the mentioned site is currently via email and password)
Moreover, referring to the 'ES2307-7a0d993a' - please notice, that
also cannot change email there (as mentioned - part of credentials in
this case).

The inability to change email or password (credentials) in a web
application can be considered a vulnerability from both a security and
usability perspective. The main risks associated with this issue
include:

- Lack of Access Control: Users cannot update their credentials,
meaning they have no way to protect their accounts if they suspect
their credentials are compromised.

- Account Takeover Risk: If an attacker gains access to an account,
the legitimate user has no way to regain control or reset their
credentials, leading to permanent account loss.

- Account Management Challenges: Users cannot update their email
addresses, which may cause issues with password recovery or receiving
security-related notifications.

Providing functionality for users to change their passwords and email
addresses is crucial for ensuring account security and effective
account management in web applications.

Relevant CWE Classifications:

CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password

Although CWE-640 primarily deals with weak password recovery
mechanisms, the inability to change passwords or email addresses fits
into this context, as it prevents users from securing their accounts
properly.

CWE-285: Improper Authorization

If the application prevents users from modifying their own
authentication credentials, it may reflect a lack of proper
authorization mechanisms for user data modification.

CWE-359: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

If the inability to change a password leaves a potentially compromised
password active, it increases the risk of unauthorized account access.

CWE-16: Configuration

This issue may also be classified as a configuration flaw, where a
critical function for user security is missing.

OWASP Top 10 (2021):

Relevant sections include A01:2021 – Broken Access Control and
A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures. These outline
risks related to access and authentication issues.

Example: https://github.com/highlight/highlight/
Affected versions <=docker-v0.4.10
(main branch - the newest ver. 2025-01-19)

Example: plausible/analytics#3102


Example: hasura/graphql-engine#10000

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission emphasizes the inability to change a
password, and a separate submission (ES2307-7a0d993a) focuses on
e-mail addresses. These submissions should probably be addressed at
the same time. Please acknowledge this point.

Response: Agree - These submissions should probably be addressed at
the same time.

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that must be fixed before the Publication stage.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
move to the Publication stage without grammar and spelling checks. American
English is used for spelling.

Comments: We suggest some minor modifications to the description to reflect
American English: "Applications should allow users 
(account owners) to change their own passwords. This is important in cases 
where data may be compromised, since the user's response should be swift, and 
users should have the opportunity to change their password to protect their 
account." Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Agree. Sorry for that and thank you so much.
