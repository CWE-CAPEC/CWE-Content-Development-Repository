ORIGIN: sub-server

SUBMISSION DATE: 2025-01-08 05:52:06

ISSUES: yes/active

ISSUE DETAILS: SUB.ABS.SUBTREE, SUB.RELREFS

PUBTRACKER: #136

GITHUBUSER: piyushroshan

SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: Stale or Unused Endpoint

DESCRIPTION:

The software contains an endpoint (API route, network service path, or
similar interface) that is no longer active, has no valid business or
functional use, or was never fully removed after development or testing.
Such endpoints can be discovered and abused by attackers, leading to
unauthorized access, data leakage, or other unintended behaviors.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or detailed) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: The proposed submission is related to CWE-489: Active Debug
Code, CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code, CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or
Function, and other entries, which presents a challenge in determining
the appropriate placement within the CWE hierarchy. The CWE team will
need to assess how and under which subtree the submission should be
placed. It might be appropriate to create a more general entry
centered around "active but unnecessary code" and include this
submission as a primary focus. We will work with you to determine the
best path forward. Please let us know what you think of this proposal.

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The OWASP references address issues similar to those raised in 
this submission. However, they do not specifically cover scenarios where 
functionality "was never fully removed after development or testing." 
Please provide additional references that address this particular aspect.
