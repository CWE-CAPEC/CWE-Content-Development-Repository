SUBMISSION COMMUNICATION ID: ES2205-dad61f86

ACTION TYPE: New Entry

SUBMISSION STATUS: Init-Consultation

ORIGIN: sub-server

SUBMISSION DATE: 2022-05-03 15:39:37

ISSUES: yes/active

ISSUE DETAILS: SUB.UNCLEAR, SUB.MITIGATION, SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK, SUB.RELS

TRACKER: #567

SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: Use of partial hash data

DESCRIPTION: 

When using the hash value of data the full value must be used to
represent the data, not a partial value (e.g. the first 8 bytes),
otherwise attacker complexity is lowered enough to allow an attacker
to create an arbitrary input that has the same partial hash value.

Please note that there are several failure scenarios, firstly a full
hash is generated but a partial hash is displayed to the user,
secondly that a full hash is generated, but a partial hash is verified
by the software.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The 2022-08-16 reply from the submitter uses phrasing such
as "When using the hash value of data, the full value of the hash must
be used to represent the data" which is focused on the mitigation, not
the weakness (see SUB.MITIGATION). After the CWE Team's further
analysis of SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK, it seems that the following name could
be used to cover both verification and display: "Reliance on a
Substring of a Full Hash Value". For the description, consider: "The
product relies on verification or display of a hash value of data, but
it only uses a substring or partial value of the hash, which lowers
the attack complexity. For example, using the first 16 bytes of a
32-byte hash reduces attack complexity by 2^128. This allows an
attacker to create a second input with the same substring or partial
hash value as the original item, even though the full hash value is
different. Or, if the user cannot view the full hash value and
validate it, then they cannot safely validate the hash of the data."
If you agree with this rephrasing, please let us know in your
response.

SUB.MITIGATION - "Too mitigation-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes missing or
incorrect mitigation without clarifying the weakness.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases unless it also
includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: See SUB.UNCLEAR discussion. Phrasing such as "the full value
must be used" as used in the 2022-08-16 reply is mitigation-oriented;
however, it could be used in Potential Mitigations when this
submission reaches the full-submission stage.

SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK - "Multiple weaknesses"

Description: The submission describes or suggests multiple independent
weaknesses that each might deserve a separate CWE ID.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
until the number of relevant weaknesses is identified. If there are
multiple weaknesses, separate names and descriptions are needed.

Comments: While the 2022-08-16 reply from the requester suggested
different phrasings for "partial hash is displayed" and "partial hash
is verified" (as originally suggested by the CWE Team), one of the
suggested names - "Reliance on a substring of the full hash value" -
seems appropriate for both scenarios: relying on the partial hash for
verification, *or* for display. So it doesn't seem that this issue
needs to be split into multiple weaknesses anymore. If the submitter
agrees, then SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK no longer applies. See SUB.UNCLEAR for
more specific details. If you agree with this decision, please
acknowledge in your response.

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The submitter acknowledged in 2022-08-16 that "The web form
forces you to put at least one relationship or other value for CWE."
This issue is related to hashing but is not necessarily "weak
hashing." The submission is not prevented from moving to the next
phase, and it will fall to the CWE Team to determine appropriate
relationships.  The team might consider classification under CWE-223:
Omission of Security-relevant Information, which was added as another
potential relationship under "RELATED WEAKNESSES".  If you agree with
this decision, please acknowledge in your response.

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that should be fixed before publication.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
be published without grammar and spelling checks. American English is used
for spelling.

Comment: grammar issues are minimal and do not prevent progression to
the next phase.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] We put it through Grammarly
and fixed a few things.
