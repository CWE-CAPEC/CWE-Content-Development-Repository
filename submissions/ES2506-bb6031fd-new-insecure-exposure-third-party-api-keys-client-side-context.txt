NAME: Insecure Exposure of Third-Party API Keys in Client-Side Context

DESCRIPTION:

The application exposes sensitive third-party API keys (e.g., Google Maps,
Firebase, Stripe, etc.) in the client-side source code or through
JavaScript-accessible runtime environments, allowing unauthorized users to
misuse the key. These keys are often not intended for public distribution
and may enable misuse, excessive billing, or data leakage.

Alternate Terms:
Publicly Accessible API Key

Exposed Cloud Service Credentials

Client-Exposed Integration Keys

Common Consequences:
Resource Consumption: Attackers may use the API key to exhaust quota or
generate billing.

Data Exposure: In cases like Firebase, misconfigured keys may grant access
to backend databases.

Reputation Damage: Abused APIs may be used in phishing or fake
applications.

Service Disruption: Abuse may trigger service provider throttling or bans.

Modes of Introduction:
Hardcoding keys into frontend JavaScript.

Embedding secrets in mobile apps or HTML files.

Exposing config files via misconfigured web servers.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:
