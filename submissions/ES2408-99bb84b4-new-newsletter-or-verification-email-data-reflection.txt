NAME: NewsLetter or Verification Email Data reflection

DESCRIPTION:

Some implementations of the newsletter or email confirmation service
receive information from the user when completing the registration form and
repeat it (or part of it) in the email sent to the users. This issue can be
exploited by cyber attackers in such a way that they fill out the
registration form or newsletter with the email of the victim user in a
targeted manner. In this process, reflective parts are filled with
malicious text and URL addresses so that the user receives it as an email
and thinks that it is from a valid organization sending the email.

Attack Scenario: 1- a Man in the middle attacker can request a friend to
sign up in the vulnerable System. 2- The target user will sign up, and the
attacker will stop his request in the network. 3- the attacker will sign up
with his email and inject the malicious link and text. 4. Target users will
receive a verification email that includes injected text and URL. The
target user checks the sender, and everything is correct (the vulnerable
official email system sends the email). 5. the user will click on the
malicious link. 6- in the malicious link, the credential can be stolen.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The submitter provides some information on the weakness via 
"receive information from the user ... and repeat it (or part of it) 
in the email sent to the users... reflective parts are filled with 
malicious text and URL addresses." This sounds like a content injection, 
however, a bit more information is needed to truly discern that.

Response: The weakness is Improper Neutralization of User-Provided
Data in Automated Outbound Email Templates, resulting in Trusted Email
Content Injection.

This occurs when an application reflects user-supplied fields (e.g.,
name, custom metadata, or free-text inputs) directly into
transactional emails such as newsletter subscriptions or account
verification messages without contextual sanitization for the email
body or embedded links.

Unlike classic Content Injection or Server-Side Template Injection
(SSTI), exploitation does not require template expression evaluation,
script execution, or client-side rendering. Instead, the impact arises
from the implicit trust of the sending domain, where emails are
authenticated via SPF/DKIM/DMARC and originate from legitimate
infrastructure.

In this scenario, the application functions as an unintentional
phishing proxy, enabling attackers to deliver malicious links or
misleading content that bypasses Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) and user
suspicion because the message is verifiably sent by a trusted
organization.

Therefore, this weakness is best characterized as a failure in
notification security logic and contextual output encoding for email
delivery systems, rather than a traditional injection flaw limited to
web or template execution contexts.


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The provided reference links to the submitter's own GitHub page,
which lists the exact description provided. Please submit a different 
reference to highlight the need for this issue.

Response:

This weakness aligns with, but is not fully addressed by, existing research and classifications:

OWASP Top 10 – A03:2021 (Injection)

OWASP explicitly states that injection vulnerabilities are not limited
to browser-based contexts and can occur in messaging and email systems
when untrusted input is reflected without proper contextual
encoding. However, OWASP does not separately classify risks arising
from trusted outbound email delivery mechanisms.

PortSwigger Web Security – Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

PortSwigger documents how user-controlled data embedded in server-side
templates can lead to security compromise. While the weakness
described here does not require template expression evaluation or code
execution, it demonstrates a related but distinct risk where email
templates reflect untrusted input, enabling phishing and credential
theft through trusted delivery channels.

Bug Bounty Reports Demonstrating Email Content Injection

Real-world exploitation of this pattern has been documented in public
bug bounty disclosures.  For example, “Bug Bounty: Email Content
Injection” (InfoSec Writeups) describes a case where
attacker-controlled input was reflected into transactional emails,
enabling malicious link injection and phishing abuse.

Additionally, HackerOne Report #1108504 documents HTML/content
injection in newsletter subscription emails, confirming that this
issue occurs in production systems and is practically exploitable.

CWE-451: User Interface Misrepresentation of Critical Information

CWE-451 partially overlaps in impact but focuses on misleading
presentation rather than the server-side failure to neutralize user
input in trusted outbound email workflows. It does not capture the
abuse of authenticated email infrastructure (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) as a
delivery vector.

These references demonstrate that while related concepts exist, the
specific risk of trusted outbound email reflection and its role in
enabling phishing via legitimate email infrastructure remains
under-represented as a distinct weakness within the current CWE
hierarchy.
