NAME: NewsLetter or Verification Email Data reflection

DESCRIPTION:

Some implementations of the newsletter or email confirmation service
receive information from the user when completing the registration form and
repeat it (or part of it) in the email sent to the users. This issue can be
exploited by cyber attackers in such a way that they fill out the
registration form or newsletter with the email of the victim user in a
targeted manner. In this process, reflective parts are filled with
malicious text and URL addresses so that the user receives it as an email
and thinks that it is from a valid organization sending the email.

Attack Scenario: 1- a Man in the middle attacker can request a friend to
sign up in the vulnerable System. 2- The target user will sign up, and the
attacker will stop his request in the network. 3- the attacker will sign up
with his email and inject the malicious link and text. 4. Target users will
receive a verification email that includes injected text and URL. The
target user checks the sender, and everything is correct (the vulnerable
official email system sends the email). 5. the user will click on the
malicious link. 6- in the malicious link, the credential can be stolen.
