NAME: Lack of reporting attacker initiated creation or modification of account

DESCRIPTION: 

Systems that allow for account creation or modification of an account
involving external identities or accounts (such as an email address,
phone number or social media account) should send a notification or
verification message (such as an email, text or voice message or
message on the social media platform) to notify that identities or
accounts that an account creation or modification event took place
using an external identity or account. Failure to send a notification
or verification message can allow attackers to silently create new
accounts or modify existing ones without users being aware that their
identity is being used or linked to attacker controlled accounts.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused". Submission's name and/or
description emphasizes the attack, not the weakness. Either the
submission's weakness is not well-understood, or it is better
described as an attack pattern, which may be suitable for inclusion in
CAPEC.

Comments: The name suggested on 2022-08-16 "Lack of reporting attacker
initiated creation or modification of account" explicitly mentions an
attacker, which should not be part of a name. The original name
over-emphasized links.  Consider this name: "Missing Notification of
Change Involving External Identities or Accounts"

Response: <submitter should reply here>

------


SUB.MITIGATION - "Too mitigation-focused". Submission's name and/or
description emphasizes missing or incorrect mitigation without
clarifying the weakness. Resolution: an initial submission cannot
progress to later phases unless it already includes a clear weakness
(i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: the 2022-08-16 desc says "... should send a notification or
verification message" which is a mitigation. The mistake - i.e., *NOT*
sending a notification - should be front-loaded in the desc and should
emphasize the behavior that contains the error.  Consider: "The
product manages accounts that use important external identity
information (such as an email address, phone number or social media
account), but it does not send a notification or verification to that
identity when an account for that identity is created or
modified. Failure to send a notification or verification message can
allow attackers to silently create new accounts or modify existing
ones without users being aware that their identity is being used or
linked to attacker controlled accounts."

Response: <submitter should reply here>

------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships". Submission suggests some
relationships, but the name/description is not explained in a way in
which the relationship is relevant. Resolution: the submission cannot
progress to later phases until more clear relationships and direct
parents are identified.

Comments: it is not immediately clear what parent relationships might
be appropriate, possibly forcing subtree modification. The CWE Team
will need to coordinate about this issue.  However, this is not
serious enough to prevent movement to the next phase.

Response: <submitter should reply here>

------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references".  Submission does not provide
any references that explain the weakness, or the relevance is not
easily found.  Resolution: the submission is not likely to progress to
later phases if there are no applicable, easily-accessible
references. The submitter could resolve by providing additional
details such as a section name and quote from the reference.  If
references still are not available, the CWE Team may decide to make an
exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The 2022-08-16 update only added a new link. It did not
address the following issue: it is not immediately clear which
sub-section from the reference(s) are associated with this submission.
These references appear to be focused on attacks. For at least one
reference, please include a sub-section name and/or page number that
highlights this issue, and for each reference, provide a brief quote
of the related material so that CWE analysts can ensure the relevance.
