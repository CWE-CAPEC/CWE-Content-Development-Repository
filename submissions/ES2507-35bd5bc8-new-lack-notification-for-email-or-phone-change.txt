NAME: Lack of notification upon malicious e-mail address / phone number change

DESCRIPTION:

An attacker who has compromised a user's authenticated session can
permanently deny the victim access to the information in their account. Due
to the e-mail and/or phone number change process not notifying the victim,
they are then also not triggered to report the apparent breach to the
system owner. To the end user, next time they attempt to log in, it seems
as if their account does not exist anymore because their e-mail address
and/or phone number (one of which will be the primary User ID and either or
both are necessary for password resets) are no longer present in the
system. Support staff would already need access to the audit trail to see
if the victim's claim of account takeover is legitimate.
