NAME: Lack of notification upon malicious e-mail address / phone number change

DESCRIPTION:

An attacker who has compromised a user's authenticated session can
permanently deny the victim access to the information in their account. Due
to the e-mail and/or phone number change process not notifying the victim,
they are then also not triggered to report the apparent breach to the
system owner. To the end user, next time they attempt to log in, it seems
as if their account does not exist anymore because their e-mail address
and/or phone number (one of which will be the primary User ID and either or
both are necessary for password resets) are no longer present in the
system. Support staff would already need access to the audit trail to see
if the victim's claim of account takeover is legitimate.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission has partial overlap with two existing
submissions.  These submissions are "ES2206-33c5627d - Account
management with insufficient verification of owner's external
identifier(s)" (CDR #23) and "ES2307-3ffe7565 - Unverified Email
Change" (CDR #62).

These submissions both involve weaknesses around personal identifiers (such as emails and phone numbers).
ES2307-3ffe7565 discusses an application that does not use a form of authentication to verify
a user before allowing an email change.  This is also related to CWE-620: Unverified Password Change.
While there is overlap, the submission you provided is focused on there not being a notification
when a change of a personal identifier happens.  These are not the same weakness but closely related.
Please note if you agree that there is some overlap between these submissions.  We are noting the
overlap to track as we move all of these submissions along, but it will not prevent this submission
from moving forward in the process.

----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or detailed) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: Although the noted submissions above that have potential overlap
might fall under CWE-620, if this submission is treated as its own weakness,
there appears to be a gap in CWE related to lack of notifications.  This has
also been noted by you in the submission.  As the submission moves further along
in the process and the overlap between the existing submissions is better understood,
the CWE team may need to make other changes to account for this potential gap.
Please indicate if you agree that there is a potential gap in CWE.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The current submission does not indicate any relationships due to
a perceived gap in CWE.  Because of this gap, it is possible there is no fitting
relationship at the moment and changes will need to be made to account for this.
We are also noting CWE-620 as a potential relationship due to it being alligned 
with the other two related submissions. Please let us know what you
think.  If you have indicated agreement with SUB.ABS.SUBTREE above,
then feel free to reference that response.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: Please include references for this submission which describe the
proposed weakness.  These will be included as supporting material and could also
provide the CWE team more insight while evaluating this submission. If you agree
with the references already mentioned in the ES2206-33c5627d and/or ES2307-3ffe7565
submissions, please let us know which references you believe are applicable.
