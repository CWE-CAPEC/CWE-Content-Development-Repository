NAME: Unauthorized iFrame Injection

DESCRIPTION:

CWE-XXXX represents a vulnerability where an attacker can inject
unauthorized iFrames into a webpage without the ability to execute
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows attackers to embed
malicious content from external sources into legitimate web pages,
potentially leading to various security risks such as phishing attacks,
malware distribution, or unauthorized data access.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating input parameters
or crafting specially crafted URLs that bypass input validation mechanisms.
For example, an attacker may inject an iFrame pointing to a malicious
website by manipulating the URL parameters, such as
example.com?url=//evil.com.


(This is essentially the opposite of CWE-1021, where an iFrame is injected
into the victim page, rather than the victim page being injected into a
malicious site)
