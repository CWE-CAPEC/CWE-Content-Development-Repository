NAME: Unauthorized iFrame Injection

DESCRIPTION:

CWE-XXXX represents a vulnerability where an attacker can inject
unauthorized iFrames into a webpage without the ability to execute
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows attackers to embed
malicious content from external sources into legitimate web pages,
potentially leading to various security risks such as phishing attacks,
malware distribution, or unauthorized data access.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating input parameters
or crafting specially crafted URLs that bypass input validation mechanisms.
For example, an attacker may inject an iFrame pointing to a malicious
website by manipulating the URL parameters, such as
example.com?url=//evil.com.


(This is essentially the opposite of CWE-1021, where an iFrame is injected
into the victim page, rather than the victim page being injected into a
malicious site)

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   Other CWE-1021
   Other CWE-601

ACTIVE ISSUES:

----------

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The submission's name identifies "iFrame Injection," which
could be regarded as a type of attack - or technical impact - that
could be enabled by a variety of root cause weaknesses (mistakes). The
URL parameter manipulation example could be interpreted as an example
of CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another
Sphere, which is the parent of CWE-601 (and distinct from
CWE-601). While the comment about the CWE-1021 relationship is noted,
it is possible for CWE-1021 to encompass both scenarios, even
malicious iframes being injected into a legitimate site.  The root
cause under CWE-1021 might be better described as "allowing iframes
from untrusted domains."  It might be necessary to change some of the
language in CWE-1021 to include this possibility. Please provide your
feedback on this discussion.

----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The proposed submission is focused on the actual attack
instead of the weakness (mistake) that leads to unauthorized iFrame
injection. Please revisit the submission to highlight the weakness
causing the vulnerability.

----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or detailed) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: As discussed in more detail in the SUB.UNCLEAR issue, both
CWE-610 and CWE-1021 could be regarded as parents of this submission,
yet they do not share the same ancestors. This could require some
deeper research to determine the appropriate changes to existing
relationships. Once the key weakness is better understood, we will be
better able to resolve this issue. Please respond and let us know your
opinion.

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: Since iframes are a specific HTML element, this submission
is likely too low-level to be assigned a new entry. It is, at best, at
a Variant level of abstraction.  As a result, these details might be
better treated as modifications to higher-level entries. Please let us
know what you think of this proposal.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: Because this submission occurs at such a low level
(SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL), it might be better to treat this submission as a
modification to other entries (e.g. CWE-1021) instead of a separate
new entry. Further discussion and identification of the core weakness
will help determine the appropriate action. Please acknowledge that
you have read this comment.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The Bugcrowd reference does not provide any specific details
about what frame injection is. Please provide another reference. One
possibility is
https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/frame-injection-attacks/,
but we would welcome other references.
