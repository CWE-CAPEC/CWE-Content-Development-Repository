NAME: Prompt Injection

DESCRIPTION:

Prompt injection is a new vulnerability that is affects some AI/ML models
and, in particular, certain types of language models using prompt-based
learning. It is the consequence of concatenating instructions and data, so
the underlying engine cannot distinguish between them. If a system uses a
LLM to generate code based on user input, and then executes that code ,
prompt injection could easily be used to generate malicious code. 

The main impact of prompt injection attacks is that it can be used to
circumvent content filters. If successful, it can deliver sensitive
information to an attacker.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission overlaps ES2308-6b80112d "Insufficient Input
Validation leading to Indirect Prompt Injection against Generative AI
Applications". Both are being declined in favor of a new, more
weakness-focused submission ES2405-84711fc4 (CDR #109), titled
"Insufficient Input Validation in Generative AI Applications". The CWE
Team will work with the AI/ML community and CDR participants to move
that new submission through the process of publication. This
submission, ES2303-fad91ac9, would be closed as a duplicate/overlap
with pointers to ES2308-6b80112d. Both submitters of the original
submissions will receive appropriate credit in any new entry/entries.

Response: [NO REPLY NEEDED]


----------

SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK - "Multiple weaknesses"

Description: The submission describes or suggests multiple independent
weaknesses that each might deserve a separate CWE ID.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
until the number of relevant weaknesses is identified. If there are
multiple weaknesses, separate names and descriptions are needed.

Comments: Since "prompt injection" is an attack, it is not clear
whether there is a single weakness that enables prompt injection to
succeed. Further discussion is needed to determine if "prompt
injection" needs to be split into multiple weaknesses.  If you can
think of multiple weaknesses that enable prompt injection, please
provide them here.

Response: [NO REPLY NEEDED]

----------

SUB.COORD - "Requires extensive coordination"

Description: The submission will require or is currently undergoing close
coordination, discussion, and debate between multiple parties with
different perspectives and opinions.  The communication could be taking
place in CDR itself, or outside of CDR.  As a result, it might take longer
to move the submission to later phases, although the submission is expected
to be more robust and well-defined as a result of this coordination.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Full-Consultation phases until sufficient consensus has been reached, or if
the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.

Comments: Since prompt injection has active interest on CDR and in the
general community, its resolution will require close
coordination. Please acknowledge this and feel free to ask any
followup questions.

Response: [NO REPLY NEEDED]


----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: As noted elsewhere, this submission overlaps another
submission. CDR has not been used to resolve duplicates in the past,
so there might be some challenges as the CWE Team figures out the best
way to process these duplicates. Please acknowledge this and feel free
to ask any followup questions.

Response: [NO REPLY NEEDED]
