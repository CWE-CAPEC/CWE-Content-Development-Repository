NAME: Prompt Injection

DESCRIPTION:

Prompt injection is a new vulnerability that is affects some AI/ML models
and, in particular, certain types of language models using prompt-based
learning. It is the consequence of concatenating instructions and data, so
the underlying engine cannot distinguish between them. If a system uses a
LLM to generate code based on user input, and then executes that code ,
prompt injection could easily be used to generate malicious code. 

The main impact of prompt injection attacks is that it can be used to
circumvent content filters. If successful, it can deliver sensitive
information to an attacker.
