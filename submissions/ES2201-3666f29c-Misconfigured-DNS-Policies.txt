NAME: Misconfigured DNS Policies


DESCRIPTION:

Misconfiguration leads to DNS mapping for the server without checking the strict policy

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION:

	because of lack strict poicies in the DNS and misconfigured SSL certificate we can access the  content of the server by pointing ouw domain/sub-domain to the server IP hence getting
	full access control of the server which includes
	->Database, Secret Files, Server Configuration, etc.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: Because the submission originated from before CDR was created and
before the web submission form existed, the CWE team considered declining
this submission and requested that the submitter re-submit their proposal
following the new submission process and guidelines. As of January 13, 2025,
no response was received for our inquiry.

Because we have insufficient details to continue submission analysis
ourselves (see SUB.UNCLEAR), we will now move this submission to the
Init-Declined phase, then close it.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED]


----------

SUB.NOINIT - "Detailed Submission with No Initial Review"

Description: A detailed submission was provided, but it did not go through
the Initial Review / Initial Consultation phases (Stage 1) and has
significant problems that should have been resolved in that phase (e.g.,
SUB.UNCLEAR).  This primarily applies to situations when external
requesters provided a "Full Submission" form (Internal-Update phase) in
2021 and 2022, before the CWE Team launched the external submission web
server and formalized the CDR process.

Resolution: The submission must be treated as part of the
Initial-Review/Initial-Consultation phase, and the detailed submission will
not be evaluated until Stage 1 is complete.

Comments: This information was provided in January 2022 using the
"Full Submission" form that was available at the time, but the CDR
process was not well-defined at the time, and the phase was
ill-advisedly set to Det-Received without having conducted any
Init-Review and Acceptance. As of September 2025, the phase will be
changed back to Init-Review, and the Det-Received date will be
removed.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED]

----------

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The exact weakness of how the DNS policies are misconfigured 
in the submission is unclear.  More clarity is needed on exactly what weakness
is being described before this submission can proceed.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>
