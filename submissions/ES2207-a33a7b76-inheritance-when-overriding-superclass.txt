NAME: Improper use of inheritance when overriding methods of an uncontrolled superclass

DESCRIPTION: 

Improper use of inheritance can not only introduce fragility but break
a program's security properties. For example, in the case of a
superclass that implements a simple collection with a number of add
methods we might have a subclass that is responsible for upholding a
predicate or security property before calling the corresponding
overridden superclass add method. If a new add method is added to the
superclass (which could happen without notifying the owner of the
subclass), any client can simply call the new superclass method thus
bypassing the security in the security enforcing subclass. This is not
a theoretical weakness and has previously impacted classes when
hashtable and vector were brought into the Java Collections.The
correct approach in such scenarios is to use composition, not
inheritance.[CWE Team - its too much to type into this little box, but
a good example of a forwarding class is in "effective java" book].In
simple terms, there is no access control with inheritance.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship
is relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what
the best parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if
SUB.UNCLEAR is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE
Team agrees that the potential relationships may require closer
investigation.  The submission cannot progress to the publication
stage until clear relationships and direct parents are identified. The
CWE Team may decide to use high-level relationships (e.g., to Pillars)
if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE exist and cannot be quickly
resolved.

Comments: SUB.RELS is applied because this entry suggests that
CWE-1357 should be its parent. However, CWE-1357 is largely
architecture/design in nature, and this is an implementation
weakness. Other CWEs such as CWE-1074 cover inheritance but are not
necessarily directly relevant to this weakness. Because SUB.UNCLEAR
does not apply to this submission, SUB.RELS does not prevent it from
moving to the next phase.  At worst, this could go under CWE-710:
Improper Adherence to Coding Standards but the best match (under
access control) would probably be CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or
Function.

Response: Is it a viable option to just have this proposal a MemberOf
CWE-1006 Bad Coding Practices with no other relationship? I appreciate
it is difficult to create a relationship to existing inheritance
related CWE.

...

I notice a number of CWE in the CWE-1006 category are also under the
CWE-710 view, so it's not uncommon in terms of relationships. It is
not a neat fit into CWE-749 as that is it is more to do with exposing
an operation with the adversary being the client. In the proposed CWE,
the defender is the client and the adversary controls the potentially
dangerous function. I would be ok with which ever you see fit

------------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or full) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: Managing "authorization" issues within code is not covered
sufficiently well within CWE and is part of a larger effort to
reorganize CWE better with respect to access control. There are many
code weaknesses applicable to Java and other object-oriented languages
that ultimately involve access control for individual fields, methods,
etc. This submission is distinct enough - but generally applicable
beyond Java - that it can progress to later phases, even if the
subtree issues are not fully solved.

Response: I agree with the comments, no further opinion from me at
this time.
