SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: PPI and sensitive informations with documents properties

DESCRIPTION:

Depends of organisation/company approach it can be intentional or not -
with documents like PDFs bad actor can check sensitive informations like
PPI (name, forname) of Author. Informations like PPI can be later used for
other parts of reconanse phrase. The same with software/device informations
- connected with Edit and Create date - bad actor can check if organisation
is using up-to-date software and so on.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This seems appropriate as an example for CWE-212: Improper
Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer. However,
CWE-359 also applies, but the overlap between CWE-212 and CWE-359
requires larger research efforts to resolve.  We plan to update
CWE-212 and CWE-359 to include PPI as a consideration. Please let us
know if you agree.

----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or full) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: The relationship between CWE-212 and CWE-359 requires larger
research efforts to resolve, but it can be resolved
independently. This is simply to notify you of the additional work
that is needed by the CWE Team. Please acknowledge that you've seen
this item.

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: It is not appropriate to create CWEs unique to PII, PHI,
PPI, or any particular kind of technology-specific data formats (such
as PDF) at such a low level, since these are probably even lower-level
than Variants. We plan to perform a Modification of the existing
CWE-212 and CWE-359 instead of creating a new entry. Please
acknowledge this point or let us know if you disagree.

----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: This is being treated as a Modification - not a New Entry.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The only provided reference is for CWE-200. Is there a more
appropriate reference that could be added?
