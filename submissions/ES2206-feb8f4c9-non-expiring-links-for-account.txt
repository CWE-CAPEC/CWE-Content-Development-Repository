NAME: Persistant links to create or change account or other privileged operation

DESCRIPTION: 

When sending messages that allow for account creation or modification
(such as via an email address, text message via phone number or
message to a social media account) the message should have a
reasonable validity time period after which it is no longer valid.

Depending on the exact scenario this may be minutes (e.g. 5-10) or
several hours or days (1-2 days for account creation). By not expiring
these links an attacker can partially open up a new account and then
complete creation later after they have hijacked or otherwise accessed
the email account associated with the request.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

  Other CWE-613

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness".  Submission's name and/or
description does not clearly identify a weakness, or it is written in
a way that is vague and could cause the submission to be incorrectly
mapped to. Resolution: an initial submission cannot progress to later
stages until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: the name implies the mistake but could be modified to
include the behavior, such as "Reliance on Non-expiring Links to
Create or Change Account."  The description is too focused on the
mitigation, although the text may be useful once Potential Mitigations
are needed in a later phase.  The first sentence of the description
could say something like "the product uses links to create an account
or make changes to an account (e.g. password reset), but the links do
not expire after a reasonable amount of time."

Response: <submitter should reply here>

------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships". Submission suggests some
relationships, but the name/description is not explained in a way in
which the relationship is relevant, or the weakness is apparent, but
it is not clear what the best parent/child relationship(s) would be.
Resolution: the submission cannot progress to publication stage until
more clear relationships and direct parents are identified, but it can
progress to other earlier stages if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.

Comments: CWE Team agrees that the issue is similar to CWE-613, but
closer investigation is needed. This does not prevent movement to the
next phase.

Response: The form requires a related CWE so we picked the least worst option.


RESOLVED ISSUES:

None.
