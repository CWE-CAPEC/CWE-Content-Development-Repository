NAME: Reliance on Non-expiring Links for Critical Operations

DESCRIPTION: 

This weakness involves the insecure practice of sending non-expiring links via
email for critical account operations, such as account creation or password
resets. Secure design principles dictate that such links should have a limited
validity period to minimize the window of opportunity for attackers. The absence
of an expiration mechanism for these links poses a significant security risk.
Ideally, the expiry timeframe should be tailored to the sensitivity of the
action being performedâ€”ranging from a few minutes (e.g., 5-10 minutes for
password resets) to a longer duration (e.g., 1-2 days for account creation
processes). Failure to implement link expiration allows attackers to exploit
these links at their convenience, potentially after gaining unauthorized access
to the associated email account.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness".  Submission's name and/or
description does not clearly identify a weakness, or it is written in
a way that is vague and could cause the submission to be incorrectly
mapped to. Resolution: an initial submission cannot progress to later
stages until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The CDR responses on 2024-02-24 provided an acceptable
description, but they did not address the name issue.  The CWE Team
has changed the name of this submission to "Reliance on Non-expiring
Links for Critical Operations" which borrows some phrasing from your
original name. Please acknowledge this change or let us know if you
disagree.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships". Submission suggests some
relationships, but the name/description is not explained in a way in
which the relationship is relevant, or the weakness is apparent, but
it is not clear what the best parent/child relationship(s) would be.
Resolution: the submission cannot progress to publication stage until
more clear relationships and direct parents are identified, but it can
progress to other earlier stages if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.

Comments: CWE Team agrees that the issue is similar to CWE-613, but
closer investigation is needed. This does not prevent movement to the
next phase.

Response: The form requires a related CWE so we picked the least worst option.


RESOLVED ISSUES:

None.
