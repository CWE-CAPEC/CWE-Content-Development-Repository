NAME: Reliance on Non-expiring Links for Critical Operations

DESCRIPTION: 

This weakness involves the insecure practice of sending non-expiring links via
email for critical account operations, such as account creation or password
resets. Secure design principles dictate that such links should have a limited
validity period to minimize the window of opportunity for attackers. The absence
of an expiration mechanism for these links poses a significant security risk.
Ideally, the expiry timeframe should be tailored to the sensitivity of the
action being performedâ€”ranging from a few minutes (e.g., 5-10 minutes for
password resets) to a longer duration (e.g., 1-2 days for account creation
processes). Failure to implement link expiration allows attackers to exploit
these links at their convenience, potentially after gaining unauthorized access
to the associated email account.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The CDR responses on 2024-02-24 provided an acceptable
description, which has been updated in this submission. However, they
did not address the name issue.  The CWE Team has changed the name of
this submission to "Reliance on Non-expiring Links for Critical
Operations" which borrows some phrasing from your original
name. Please acknowledge this change or let us know if you disagree.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The CWE Team agrees that the issue is similar to CWE-613,
but closer investigation is needed. We acknowledge the submitter's
comment that "The form requires a related CWE so we picked the least
worst option."  The lack of a clear relationship will not prevent
movement to the next phase. Please acknowledge that you have read this
comment and are aware of this potential difficulty.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


RESOLVED ISSUES:

None.
