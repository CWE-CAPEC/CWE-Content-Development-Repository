NAME: CWE-117 modification new demonstrative example

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code foru00a0PHP languageu00a0 for the given
description:

Demonstrative Examples:

````
<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];

try 
{
    if (strlen($username) > 20) 
    {
	throw new Exception("Username too long");
    }
} 
catch (Exception $e) 
{
    error_log("User registration failed: " . $username);
}
?>
`````

The above PHP code logs the username directly without sanitization. An
attacker can inject newline (%0A) characters in the username parameter,
causing log injection. For example, submitting
hacker%0AAdmin+Access+Granted would result in a manipulated log entry:

````

User registration failed: hacker
Admin Access Granted

````
This could trick administrators into believing false events occurred or
even bypass security monitoring systems.
