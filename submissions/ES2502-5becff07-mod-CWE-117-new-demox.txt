NAME: CWE-117 modification new demonstrative example

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code for PHP language for the given
description.

Demonstrative Examples:

````
<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];

try 
{
    if (strlen($username) > 20) 
    {
	throw new Exception("Username too long");
    }
} 
catch (Exception $e) 
{
    error_log("User registration failed: " . $username);
}
?>
`````

The above PHP code logs the username directly without sanitization. An
attacker can inject newline (%0A) characters in the username parameter,
causing log injection. For example, submitting
hacker%0AAdmin+Access+Granted would result in a manipulated log entry:

````

User registration failed: hacker
Admin Access Granted

````
This could trick administrators into believing false events occurred or
even bypass security monitoring systems.

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: This example is reasonable, but we will need to add more
details. In Stage 2, we will work with you to refine this example to
fit with CWE's expected style, such as introductory text and a "good
code" example to demonstrate the fix.
