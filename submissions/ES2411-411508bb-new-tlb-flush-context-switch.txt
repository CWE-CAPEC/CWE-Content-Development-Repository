NAME: TLB Flush on Context Switch

DESCRIPTION:

The linux kernel flushes the entire tlb on riscv for versions <=5.11. This
can be exploited to perform side channel attacks figure out the page table
location bits of a victim process thus compromising KASLR. Previous methods
that implement this attack overflow the tlb in order to flush it. This
introduces noise into the attack during the cache timing phase. Instead of
this, attackers can use the tlb flush on context switch by utilizing
functions like sleep() to obtain a lower noise communication channel
through the cache. Specifically,

1) The attacker primes the cache, calls sleep() to flush the tlb and allow
the attacker to execute. The victim process with then leave traces of its
tlb walk in the cache.
2) The attacker can then probe the cache to identify which cache lines have
been accessed thus leaking bits of the page table locations.

Many current RISCV implementations run versions of the linux kernel <=5.11
(Eg CVA6 on github) hence this may compromise the security of existing
RISCV systems.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.MISSDET - "Missing details"

Description: The submission is missing some requested or required details
for elements other than name and description.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases if it does not
have all required elements.

Comments: This issue appears to be a report for a specific vulnerability, 
instead of a request for updating weaknessinformation in CWE. A followup 
inquiry is being sent to confirm this assumption.

Response: Submitter said: "It is not specific to a certain
product. All riscv cores using those versions of the linux kernel will
be affected by it."
