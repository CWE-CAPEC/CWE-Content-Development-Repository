NAME: Improper implemented email address contact or weblinks support unintended results

DESCRIPTION:

It is very important for site owners or team members responsible for site
content to provide corrects data. From time to time we can see incorrect
provided email addresses to contact or incorrect website links. User will
doesn't know if it is intentional, accidental or made by bad actors (but
this source is for visitor/user trust, authorized). Depends on focus part -
incorrect email addresses are a threat, as well as incorrect given website
links. Examples: example@example.com vs exampe@example.com, or
example@example.co and so on. For sites also many cases, the same with
added comapny's social links - when added incorrect, bad actor can easy
attack (ie. if given nonexistent (typo for example) social media account -
bad actor can create with this name).
