NAME: Improper implemented email address contact or weblinks support unintended results

DESCRIPTION:

It is very important for site owners or team members responsible for site
content to provide corrects data. From time to time we can see incorrect
provided email addresses to contact or incorrect website links. User will
doesn't know if it is intentional, accidental or made by bad actors (but
this source is for visitor/user trust, authorized). Depends on focus part -
incorrect email addresses are a threat, as well as incorrect given website
links. Examples: example@example.com vs exampe@example.com, or
example@example.co and so on. For sites also many cases, the same with
added comapny's social links - when added incorrect, bad actor can easy
attack (ie. if given nonexistent (typo for example) social media account -
bad actor can create with this name).

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The way the submission is written makes it difficult to
understand where the weakness lies. Is the issue with users typing
incorrect email addresses? Is attackers creating fake emails and using
those email addresses an issue? Is it in validation of the email
addresses by the product?  What is the problem with incorrect email
addresses from a security context?  Please provide clarity into what
the mistake is that warrants this being a new CWE? For the rest of
this review, we assume that you mean something like "user or admin has
entered or recorded an incorrect email address into the product."
Please let us know if we are understanding correctly.

SCOPE.ADMINERR - "Admin/user error"

Description: The issue focuses on security errors that are made by an admin
or user of the product/service, not the developer or maintainer of the
product/service.

Resolution: Submissions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, delayed,
and possibly cited as examples until this exclusion is finalized after
extensive community feedback.

Comments: This appears to align with user/admin error, and not
something that the developer or maintainer of the product can
control. If this is the case, then this submission cannot be included
in CWE, which focuses only on weaknesses in software itself. Please
let us know if you agree or if there are other perspectives to
consider.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The reference provided deals with content spoofing, which
focuses more on the actual content injection. This doesn't appear to align
with the proposed submission. Please provide specific reference(s) to highlight
the issue being presented.
