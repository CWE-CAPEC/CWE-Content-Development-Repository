NAME: Improper implemented email address contact or weblinks support unintended results

DESCRIPTION:

It is very important for site owners or team members responsible for site
content to provide corrects data. From time to time we can see incorrect
provided email addresses to contact or incorrect website links. User will
doesn't know if it is intentional, accidental or made by bad actors (but
this source is for visitor/user trust, authorized). Depends on focus part -
incorrect email addresses are a threat, as well as incorrect given website
links. Examples: example@example.com vs exampe@example.com, or
example@example.co and so on. For sites also many cases, the same with
added company's social links - when added incorrect, bad actor can easy
attack (ie. if given nonexistent (typo for example) social media account -
bad actor can create with this name).

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The way the submission is written makes it difficult to
understand where the weakness lies. Is the issue with users typing
incorrect email addresses? Is attackers creating fake emails and using
those email addresses an issue? Is it in validation of the email
addresses by the product?  What is the problem with incorrect email
addresses from a security context?  Please provide clarity into what
the mistake is that warrants this being a new CWE? For the rest of
this review, we assume that you mean something like "user or admin has
entered or recorded an incorrect email address into the product."
Please let us know if we are understanding correctly.

Response: Thank you for pointing this out. To clarify: the core
weakness is when software does not validate or verify user- or
admin-supplied contact information (e.g., email addresses, social
media handles, website URLs) that are presented in a trusted context
(e.g., company profile page, team member bio, footer, or "Contact Us"
section).

This leads to multiple exploitable outcomes:

- If an incorrect email address is shown due to a typo or unverified
  field (e.g., contact@orgaization.com instead of
  contact@organization.com), an attacker can register the incorrect
  domain and hijack communication intended for the legitimate party.

- If a nonexistent social media account is referenced (due to typo or
  misentry), an attacker can register it and impersonate the entity.

If a website link is entered incorrectly, it can redirect users to
malicious content or lead to domain squatting/takeover.  These
weaknesses exist because the product lacks validation/verification of
displayed external-facing identity links, and users place trust in
this content being accurate and vetted. This results in a security
risk that is rooted in software design, not merely human error.

----------

SCOPE.ADMINERR - "Admin/user error"

Description: The issue focuses on security errors that are made by an admin
or user of the product/service, not the developer or maintainer of the
product/service.

Resolution: Submissions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, delayed,
and possibly cited as examples until this exclusion is finalized after
extensive community feedback.

Comments: This appears to align with user/admin error, and not
something that the developer or maintainer of the product can
control. If this is the case, then this submission cannot be included
in CWE, which focuses only on weaknesses in software itself. Please
let us know if you agree or if there are other perspectives to
consider.

Response: I respectfully disagree with the classification of this as a
pure admin/user error. While the incorrect data may be entered by a
user or admin, the underlying weakness lies in the software's failure
to verify or validate that information before displaying it as trusted
output.

Software that displays externally facing contact data (e.g., emails,
URLs, social handles) without confirming that the values are:

- properly formatted,
- correctly associated with the entity,
- not susceptible to takeover,

is exposing users to security risks. This is similar in principle to
CWE-1288 (Improper Validation of Consistency within Input), but more
specific to trust-inducing identity fields. Therefore, I believe the
issue qualifies as a design-level weakness, not just a user error.

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The reference provided deals with content spoofing, which
focuses more on the actual content injection. This doesn't appear to align
with the proposed submission. Please provide specific reference(s) to highlight
the issue being presented. 

Response: Thank you for this feedback. Below are specific, relevant
references where incorrect or unverified user-facing contact data led
to security consequences:

Social media account hijacking — VDP:

Facebook Username Takeover via Broken Link in Footer:
https://hackerone.com/reports/3119034

Domain Takeover [3737signals.com]
https://hackerone.com/reports/1253926

These references demonstrate that when trusted identity information
(emails, social handles, websites) is not validated, attackers can
exploit the inconsistency to redirect, impersonate, or hijack
communications.

In simple terms, the problem is this: the product provides incorrect
data that can be harmful to the user.

While human error is always a factor, the focus here is that the
software or product itself is responsible for directing the user (or
victim) to malicious or phishing websites—despite being a trusted and
official source. The application is not compromised, yet it displays
or links to incorrect external resources. This creates a false sense
of security and enables attackers to carry out various forms of abuse,
especially those targeting the takeover of external accounts (e.g.,
hijacking unclaimed social media handles, spoofing domains, or
impersonating contact emails).
