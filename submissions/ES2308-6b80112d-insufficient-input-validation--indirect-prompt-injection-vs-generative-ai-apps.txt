NAME: Insufficient Input Validation leading to Indirect Prompt Injection against Generative AI Applications

DESCRIPTION:

Many generative artificial intelligence applications rely on external
sources to augment user prompts. This augmentation can be from plugins or
data stores and is often used to extend functionality and improve accuracy.
However, users with access to add information to these sources can perform
prompt injection attacks, impacting targeted or untargeted third-party
users. This weakness is unique to common "jailbreak" prompt injections in
the attacker's ability to impact other users. Awareness of this weakness is
critical for application developers, as most retrieval augmented generation
methods involve scraping and indexing vast amounts of information with
little regard to how it could be appropriately sanitized.
