NAME: PWE-6: Identifier does not match data structure object type

DESCRIPTION:

Typically, a data structure has a unique identifier to inform the parser
developer what data type to allocate. During identifier type confusion, the
data structure may not adequately model the presented identifier such that
the parser may have to assume compliance of the identified type. Before
assuming that the identifier is correct, thoroughly understand the unique
properties that identify a data type.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   Other CWE-1025
   Other CWE-240

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or full) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: Due to this submission potentially fitting in as a child in multiple
places within the CWE subtree, this could indicate an issue in the subtree with
respect to how weaknesses related to data parsing are laid out.  It's unclear
if a branch in the subtree should be entirely dedicated to parsing weaknesses or
if they should be spread out across the current subtree where they currently fit
best.  This issue does not need to be resolved for the submission to progress
to later phases and will require further research and effort from the CWE team.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The currently suggested relationships are CWE-1025 and CWE-240.
CWE-1025 does not seem to apply because it is focused on the comparison between
two entities, whereas the submission is focused on parsing input.  CWE-240 seems
somewhat relevant, but at the subtree of CWE-237: Improper Handling of
Structural Elements, it seems like a more appropriate relationship would be
CWE-241: Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type.  This is because the parser
sees an identifier which it expects to be one data type, but the actual content
is another data type, leading to the "unexpected" aspect.  CWE-1286: Improper
Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input seems like it could also apply, but
may not be suitable because the submission doesn't necessarily specify that the
input is syntactically incorrect, just that it is not the format expected based
on the identifier.  Please let us know your thoughts on the proposed
relationships, specifically if you think CWE-241 is a good fit.
