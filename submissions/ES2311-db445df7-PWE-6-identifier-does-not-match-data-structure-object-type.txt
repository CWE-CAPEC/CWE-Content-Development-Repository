NAME: PWE-6: Identifier does not match data structure object type

DESCRIPTION:

Typically, a data structure has a unique identifier to inform the parser
developer what data type to allocate. During identifier type confusion, the
data structure may not adequately model the presented identifier such that
the parser may have to assume compliance of the identified type. Before
assuming that the identifier is correct, thoroughly understand the unique
properties that identify a data type.
