NAME: Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party service

DESCRIPTION:

The product is using third-party service that contains at least one known
vulnerability. Example: product use external (third-party) service (ie. to
fetch images or other activity) where occurs Open Redirect issue, that
leads in some cases to weak point also in the product. Example: other
popular case is - product don't allow to upload dangerous type files, but
is using external service delegated to minor tasks and there it is allowed
- bad actor can exploit this connection, upload payloads and use link which
contain product name, victim as customer will be more focused on the known
name (product) and can skip the other part (third-party service where
product occurs as customer) and in fact in will be real valid link (mix of
product name and external service).

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The submitter identifies a specific example of an already exisiting
CWE-1395. The example provided is too specific to warrant its own CWE. However, the
extended description could be modified to mention the use of third-party services. If the
submitter can provide detailed references, the CWE team may be able to include
them as demonstrative examples or list them in references.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Based on the comment in SUB.OVERLAP, it is better for this submission
to be a modification of CWE-1395 instead of warrating a new CWE.
