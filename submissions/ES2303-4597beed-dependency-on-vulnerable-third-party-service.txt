NAME: Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party service

DESCRIPTION:

The product is using third-party service that contains at least one known
vulnerability. Example: product use external (third-party) service (ie. to
fetch images or other activity) where occurs Open Redirect issue, that
leads in some cases to weak point also in the product. Example: other
popular case is - product don't allow to upload dangerous type files, but
is using external service delegated to minor tasks and there it is allowed
- bad actor can exploit this connection, upload payloads and use link which
contain product name, victim as customer will be more focused on the known
name (product) and can skip the other part (third-party service where
product occurs as customer) and in fact in will be real valid link (mix of
product name and external service).

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The submitter identifies a specific example of an already exisiting
CWE-1395. The example provided is too specific to warrant its own CWE. However, the
extended description could be modified to mention the use of third-party services. If the
submitter can provide detailed references, the CWE team may be able to include
them as demonstrative examples or list them in references.

Response:

Thank you for the feedback. I agree that the described behavior is
closely related to CWE-1395: Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party
Component. However, I would like to clarify and propose the inclusion
of explicit examples involving hosted third-party services, not just
libraries or SDKs, to highlight how this dependency manifests in
practice.

The key point is that a product can appear secure in isolation but
becomes vulnerable through integration with an external third-party
web service (e.g., file processing, media rendering, link redirection)
that introduces exploitable weaknesses such as open redirects or
improper file handling. These cases are particularly impactful when
the user implicitly trusts the product’s domain or brand, unaware of
the delegation to a third-party backend.

I propose that the extended description of CWE-1395 be updated to
include a specific mention of: Dependencies not only on third-party
components/libraries, but also third-party web services or APIs
Exploitation scenarios where attacker leverages trust in the primary
product while abusing the underlying vulnerable service

I would be happy to provide real-world references and more detailed
example writeups for inclusion in CWE-1395’s demonstrative cases.

Quick example - Demonstration of how a third-party domain used by a
major company for redirection (e.g., newsletters or file delivery) was
vulnerable to open redirects / content spoofing. Attackers were able
to craft links that appeared trustworthy because they started with the
brand’s URL or were used in branded contexts.

Description - illustrates the severe consequences of SSRF

gain unauthorized access, emphasizing the importance of addressing
such vulnerabilities, especially when they stem from third-party

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Based on the comment in SUB.OVERLAP, it is better for this submission
to be a modification of CWE-1395 instead of warrating a new CWE.

Response: Acknowledged. Given the clear overlap with CWE-1395, I
support changing the action from a request for a new CWE to a
modification request for CWE-1395. The intent of this submission is to
enrich that entry by illustrating another practical and increasingly
relevant exploitation path — through the use of vulnerable third-party
services tied to a product’s functionality, branding, or delivery
chain.

Please proceed with the action as "Modification", and I remain
available to assist with detailed case documentation or supporting
references as needed.
