NAME:  Reverse Proxy Flow Interference (Frontjacking)

DESCRIPTION:

Frontend server hijacking or Frontjacking, is a hacking technique that
combines CRLF injection, HTTP request header injection and XSS, exploiting
a poorly configured reverse proxy deployed with a shared hosting
environment, allowing attackers to inject a new host header, hijack the
frontend server and replace the accessed server with an attacker-controlled
server.This enables the attacker to execute any reflected XSS and phishing
related payloads while bypassing any defensive mechanisms including CSP
(Content Security Policy), HttpOnly cookie attributes, WAFs (Web
Application Firewalls), CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) and HTTPS
certificate validation.
