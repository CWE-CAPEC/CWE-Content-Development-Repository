NAME:  Reverse Proxy Flow Interference (Frontjacking)

DESCRIPTION:

Frontend server hijacking or Frontjacking, is a hacking technique that
combines CRLF injection, HTTP request header injection and XSS, exploiting
a poorly configured reverse proxy deployed with a shared hosting
environment, allowing attackers to inject a new host header, hijack the
frontend server and replace the accessed server with an attacker-controlled
server. This enables the attacker to execute any reflected XSS and phishing
related payloads while bypassing any defensive mechanisms including CSP
(Content Security Policy), HttpOnly cookie attributes, WAFs (Web
Application Firewalls), CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) and HTTPS
certificate validation.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   Other CWE-451
   Other CWE-79

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The description does not clarify what the weakness is,
focusing more on the attack. What is the key mistake that allows the
attack to succeed?

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The description does not clarify what the weakness is,
focusing more on the attack with phrases such as "server hijacking" -
but there is an even greater emphasis on the potential impacts such as
"bypassing any defensive mechanisms."  What is the key mistake that
allows the attack to succeed?

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: the emphasis on "server hijacking" related to a "poorly
configured reverse proxy" is too narrow for a particular
technology. So, instead of creating a new CWE entry, it would be
better to integrate this information into existing CWEs (e.g., CWE-93,
CWE-79, and/or "header injection" somewhere under CWE-74). Please let
us know what you think about this proposal.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Instead of creating a new entry, we plan to update one or
more existing CWEs to account for this attack somehow: CWE-93, CWE-79,
and/or "header injection" somewhere under CWE-74).  Please let us know
what you think about this proposal.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: While a modification might be possible, we are not sure what
changes to make until we better understand what the root cause
weakness is.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>




RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.IPR - "IP Rights Concerns"

Description: The submission might have concerns related to intellectual
property rights, e.g., by citing or deriving content from sources that are
subject to significant restrictions, or if the content is copied verbatim
from a source without attribution (i.e., plagiarism).

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until it is
clear that there are no IP concerns.

Comments: This proposal is from the submitter's own presentation, so
there are no IP concerns.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE]
