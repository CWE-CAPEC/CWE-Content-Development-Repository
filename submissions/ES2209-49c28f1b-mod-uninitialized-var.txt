NAME: uninitialized variable vulnerability - Problem with boolean variables that are forcibly initialized to false by the Java compiler

DESCRIPTION:

Sites such as CWE and VULNCAT all describe only code quality and
memory problems, so I made an example code for the vulnerability of an
uninitialized variable(CWE-457, CWE-456). In the Java language,
boolean member variables that are not explicitly initialized are
forcibly initialized to false by the compiler
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.5). This
can lead to logic vulnerabilities(CWE-840). If Java had a type like
Python's NoneType
(https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/constants.html), this might not
have happened. detail :

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: The related weaknesses identified, especially, CWE-456 and
CWE-457 cover this issue well. This issue only highlights an example
of a boolean type. In this case, we agree that it would be best to
create a demonstrative example in one or both of these entries to
cover the boolean type in Java (if that isn't covered already),
instead of creating a new CWE entry.  CWE-456 and CWE-457 can also be
improved overall using the information shared in this submission, but
a new CWE isn't needed.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE]
