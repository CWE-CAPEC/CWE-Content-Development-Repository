NAME: Improper or lack of checking leaked credentials

DESCRIPTION:

It is good and responsible approach to validate entered password by user
during registration steps by trusted parties, services like HIBP (Have I
Been Pwned) - thanks to this using the most popular and very weak passwords
can be prevented at the beginning. Other approach is periodically checks
the leaked credentials for users safety - in case of leaked data, inform
them about need of changing current password (before attackers will exploit
this).
