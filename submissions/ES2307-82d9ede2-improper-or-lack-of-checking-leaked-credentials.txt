SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: Improper or lack of checking leaked credentials

DESCRIPTION:

It is good and responsible approach to validate entered password by user
during registration steps by trusted parties, services like HIBP (Have I
Been Pwned) - thanks to this using the most popular and very weak passwords
can be prevented at the beginning. Other approach is periodically checks
the leaked credentials for users safety - in case of leaked data, inform
them about need of changing current password (before attackers will exploit
this).

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MITIGATION - "Too mitigation-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes missing or
incorrect mitigation without clarifying the weakness.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases unless it also
includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The proposed submission is entirely mitigation focused. As such,
it would be appropriate to include that in "Potential Mitigation" section 
within the existing CWEs. It makes sense to include the suggested guidance
in CWE-1391. The CWE team will also expand the use of the "reuse" term to reflect
already compromised / breached passwords. Please confirm that you are OK with the change.

Response: Thank you for the clarification. I understand that the current
submission emphasizes mitigation and not a clearly defined weakness. I
agree with your assessment, and I am fine with incorporating the relevant
content as a potential mitigation under existing CWE entries, particularly
CWE-1391. I also support the inclusion of guidance regarding the reuse of
already compromised or breached passwords, and expanding the terminology
accordingly. 

I agree with you. 


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The CWE team has changed the URL of the NCSC reference
because the original URL was 404. We also added a reference to NIST
Special Publication 800-63B, which specifically addresses "breached"
passwords in several sections, including Section 5.1.1.2. Please
verify that you agree with the change.

Response: Thank you for updating the reference and adding NIST SP 800-63B.
I agree with the inclusion of this document, as Section 5.1.1.2 provides
direct support for the security concern regarding compromised passwords. I
also acknowledge the updated URL for the NCSC blog post and appreciate the
clarification. These references appropriately strengthen the submission. 

I agree with you.



----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Based on the other issues identified above, this submission would
result in modification of existing CWEs. Please confirm that you are OK 
with that.

Response: I confirm that I am fine with changing the submission from a "New
Entry" to a "Modification" of existing CWE(s). I understand that this will
shift the focus from creating a standalone weakness to contributing to and
enhancing the existing taxonomy where appropriate. 

I agree with you.
