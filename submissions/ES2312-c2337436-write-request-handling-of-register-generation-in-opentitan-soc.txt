NAME: Improper Neutralization in Write Request Handling of Register Generation in OpenTitan SoC

DESCRIPTION:

The weakness lies in the handling of write requests to reserved addresses
in the module for register generation (scmi_reg_top) of the OpenTitan SoC.
When a write request is made to a reserved address, the system correctly
identifies this as an error and discards the write operation. However, it
fails to provide feedback about this discarded operation. This lack of
feedback mechanism is a concern because it could lead to lost data or
unpredictable system behavior, as the system might silently ignore a write
during an error without notification. This could potentially be exploited
by an attacker to insert malicious writes into the code. The primary
technical impact of this vulnerability is the potential for data loss and
can be used to gain unauthorized access by attackers. Moreover, if the
system discards a write operation but fails to notify the user or the rest
of the system, it could lead to decisions or actions based on incorrect
data.
