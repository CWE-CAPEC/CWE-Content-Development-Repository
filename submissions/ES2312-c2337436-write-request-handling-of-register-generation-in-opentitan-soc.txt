NAME: Improper Neutralization in Write Request Handling of Register Generation in OpenTitan SoC

DESCRIPTION:

The weakness lies in the handling of write requests to reserved addresses
in the module for register generation (scmi_reg_top) of the OpenTitan SoC.
When a write request is made to a reserved address, the system correctly
identifies this as an error and discards the write operation. However, it
fails to provide feedback about this discarded operation. This lack of
feedback mechanism is a concern because it could lead to lost data or
unpredictable system behavior, as the system might silently ignore a write
during an error without notification. This could potentially be exploited
by an attacker to insert malicious writes into the code. The primary
technical impact of this vulnerability is the potential for data loss and
can be used to gain unauthorized access by attackers. Moreover, if the
system discards a write operation but fails to notify the user or the rest
of the system, it could lead to decisions or actions based on incorrect
data.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: This submission appears to be a report about a specific
vulnerability in a specific product, which the submitter wants to
disclose in a public report.  If that is the case, then the
appropriate action is to request a CVE identifier via
https://cveform.mitre.org/ .

If this is not a request about a specific vulnerability, then this
submission could possibly be used as a demonstrative example in the
appropriate CWE entry - as long as the vulnerability has been
published.

Please clarify the situation.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: this appears to be an example of CWE-392: Missing Report of
Error Condition.  It does not appear to be related to CWE-1191 or
CWE-1256, since both are related to the ability for an adversary to
bypass intended access control, but the submission is not saying that
there is a problem with restricting access to the write
operation. Please confirm.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This submission appears to be a report about a specific
vulnerability (not reporting errors) in a specific product
(OpenTitan), but CWE entries are about the types of weaknesses that
lead to vulnerabilities. Unless other problems are resolved (see
above), we cannot move forward with this submission.
