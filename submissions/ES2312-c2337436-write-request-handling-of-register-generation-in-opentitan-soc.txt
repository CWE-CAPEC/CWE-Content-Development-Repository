NAME: Lack of Feedback for Unexecuted Operations Across System Interfaces

DESCRIPTION:

This weakness focuses on the silent omission of feedback when
operations are not just errored, but unexecuted or ignored due to
system constraints or design decisions. This weakness is not limited
to any specific technology or context, but can occur in any system
where operations can be discarded without feedback or notification. A
primary example of this weakness is found in the OpenTitan
System-on-Chip’s scmi_reg_top module, where write requests to reserved
addresses are correctly identified as errors and discarded, but
without any feedback provided.

Therefore, this weakness category captures issues across various
hardware interfaces where operations are discarded without any
feedback, error handling, or logging. Such omissions can lead to data
loss, security vulnerabilities, and system instability, with potential
impacts ranging from minor to catastrophic.

1) SoC systems, like OpenTitan: The example of write operations to
reserved addresses being discarded without feedback directly
exemplifies the weakness. It showcases a specific case where the
system's failure to inform about discarded operations could lead to
misinterpretations about the system's state or the success of
operations, fitting the weakness perfectly.

2) Microcontroller interrupt systems: Ignored interrupts due to
priority conflicts or system errors without signaling highlight a
failure in the system's communication about operational
decisions. This directly contributes to the weakness by showing how
critical feedback mechanisms are absent in scenarios where system
limitations affect operation execution.

3) Network interface controllers: The failure to report buffer
overflows and the subsequent dropping of packets without notification
is a clear instance of the system not providing feedback on crucial
operational failures, leading to data loss and potential communication
breakdowns.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: This submission appears to be a report about a specific
vulnerability in a specific product, which the submitter wants to
disclose in a public report.  If that is the case, then the
appropriate action is to request a CVE identifier via
https://cveform.mitre.org/ .

If this is not a request about a specific vulnerability, then this
submission could possibly be used as a demonstrative example in the
appropriate CWE entry - as long as the vulnerability has been
published.

Please clarify the situation.

Response: Thank you for your feedback. To clarify, our submission
identifies a generalized weakness that can be better titled “Lack of
Feedback for Unexecuted Operations Across System Interfaces”. Unlike
the broader issue of failing to indicate error conditions with status
codes or return values, this weakness focuses on the silent omission
of feedback when operations are not just errored, but unexecuted or
ignored due to system constraints or design decisions. This weakness
is not limited to any specific technology or context, but can occur in
any system where operations can be discarded without feedback or
notification. A primary example of this weakness is found in the
OpenTitan System-on-Chip’s scmi_reg_top module, where write requests
to reserved addresses are correctly identified as errors and
discarded, but without any feedback provided.

Therefore, this weakness category captures issues across various
hardware interfaces where operations are discarded without any
feedback, error handling, or logging. Such omissions can lead to data
loss, security vulnerabilities, and system instability, with potential
impacts ranging from minor to catastrophic.

1) SoC systems, like OpenTitan: The example of write operations to
reserved addresses being discarded without feedback directly
exemplifies the weakness. It showcases a specific case where the
system's failure to inform about discarded operations could lead to
misinterpretations about the system's state or the success of
operations, fitting the weakness perfectly.

2) Microcontroller interrupt systems: Ignored interrupts due to
priority conflicts or system errors without signaling highlight a
failure in the system's communication about operational
decisions. This directly contributes to the weakness by showing how
critical feedback mechanisms are absent in scenarios where system
limitations affect operation execution.

3) Network interface controllers: The failure to report buffer
overflows and the subsequent dropping of packets without notification
is a clear instance of the system not providing feedback on crucial
operational failures, leading to data loss and potential communication
breakdowns.

In addition, to address the specific instance within the OpenTitan
SoC, a CVE report can be submitted, where: the CVE identification
process will address the particular vulnerability, while this CWE
submission will serve to inform the broader software and hardware
development communities about the general weakness.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: this appears to be an example of CWE-392: Missing Report of
Error Condition.  It does not appear to be related to CWE-1191 or
CWE-1256, since both are related to the ability for an adversary to
bypass intended access control, but the submission is not saying that
there is a problem with restricting access to the write
operation. Please confirm.

Response: The submission intended to highlight a weakness where write
operations to reserved addresses are not reported back to the user due
to a lack of feedback mechanisms. This indeed aligns more closely with
CWE-392: "Missing Report of Error Condition" as it directly concerns
the system's failure to notify the user of unsuccessful
operations. Given this clarification, I propose that the primary
relationship of this vulnerability should be with CWE-392 as the
direct parent, clarifying the misalignment with CWE-1191 and CWE-1256.

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This submission appears to be a report about a specific
vulnerability (not reporting errors) in a specific product
(OpenTitan), but CWE entries are about the types of weaknesses that
lead to vulnerabilities. Unless other problems are resolved (see
above), we cannot move forward with this submission.

Response: Acknowledging the feedback on the specificity of our
submission, we have refined our focus to present a more generalized
weakness, aptly titled "Lack of Feedback for Unexecuted Operations
Across System Interfaces." This weakness encapsulates the critical
issue where systems, spanning a spectrum of technologies, fail to
notify or log the non-execution or disregard of operations due to
various reasons including system constraints, design decisions, or
errors. This can occur across a broad range of system interfaces, from
hardware components like SoC modules to communication protocols, thus
leading to vulnerabilities. The responses for the aforementioned
problems aim to resolve the issue about the generalizability of this
weakness.
