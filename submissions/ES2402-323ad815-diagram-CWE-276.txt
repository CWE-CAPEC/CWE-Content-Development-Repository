RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: The CWE team coordinated with the submitter to create a new
image. Unrelated usability work caused a delay in making other
significant changes to CWE-276. The CWE Team later created their own
adapted version of the image and decided that the diagram could be
added without resolving other issues in CWE-276.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE]
