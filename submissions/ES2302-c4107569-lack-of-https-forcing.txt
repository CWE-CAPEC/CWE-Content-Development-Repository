NAME: Lack of HTTPS Forcing

DESCRIPTION:

In some cases it can be not important, but in other - it can be very
important (if bad actor can easy get info about some of user activity and
'connection' with definite site using sniffing etc). We can add this as
variant or new record - here I want to be focused on quite often overlooked
case - no HTTPS forcing for used assets like images. POC - site/service has
proper HTTPS forcing, but for assets like images it doesn't work properly
(no HTTP forcing - HTTP instead of HTTPS). Proposed remediation: HTTPS
Forcing also for used assets like images, and so on.
