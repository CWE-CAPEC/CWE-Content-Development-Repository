NAME: PWE-4: Mishandling of duplicate data structure object

DESCRIPTION:

In parsing code, when designing data structure objects; check that
duplicate objects do not exist. Duplicate keys may result in parser
differentials. Parsers may take individually defined methods of resolving a
duplicate entry. Often file formats do not restrict or prohibit duplicate
objects and leaves error handling up to the parser. In most cases,
duplicate keys are an error. However, the parser may want to handle it
gracefully, leading to ambiguous behavior.
