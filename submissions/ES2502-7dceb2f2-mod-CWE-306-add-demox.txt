NAME: Add demonstrative example to CWE-306

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code for PHP language for the given
description.

Demonstrative Examples:

`````
<?php
function registerUser($username, $email, $password) {
    $file = fopen("users.txt", "a"); // Store user details in a text file
    fwrite($file, "$username, $email, $password
");
    fclose($file);
    
    return "User registered successfully!";
}

echo registerUser($_GET['username'], $_GET['email'], $_GET['password']);
?>
````
This PHP code is vulnerable because it allows anyone to create user
accounts without authentication. The `registerUser` function directly takes
user input from `$_GET` and writes it to `users.txt`, without verifying if
the requester has permission to register a new user.

An attacker could exploit this by sending a request like:
```

http://example.com/register.php?username=hacker&email=hacker@example.com&password=123456

```
This would successfully create a new user account, allowing unauthorized
individuals to flood the system with fake accounts or even register
privileged admin accounts if the system does not enforce proper role
management.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: Can you clarify what you had intended with "without verifying 
if the requester has permission to register a new user" in context of
CWE-306? This example is reasonable, but we will need to add more details. 
In Stage 2, we will work with you to refine this example to fit with CWE's 
expected style, such as introductory text and a "good code" example for
both authentication and authorization to demonstrate the fix. Additionally, 
the current code would also have to change to highlight the intended use of it 
as an admin-only functionality. Please provide a response to the question
and confirm that you acknowledge the comment.
