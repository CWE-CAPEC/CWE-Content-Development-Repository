NAME: Improper Validation of Generative AI Output

DESCRIPTION:

The product invokes a generative AI/ML component whose behaviors and outputs
cannot be directly controlled, but the product does not sufficiently
validate the outputs to ensure that they align with the intended
security, content, or privacy policy.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   ChildOf CWE-707

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: On Friday, June 28, 2024, the WG decided that even if a
new-entry submission did not meet CWE's full quality/comprehensiveness
requirements, that it would be beneficial to the community to ensure
its inclusion in CWE 4.15 (July 16) and improve it in subsequent
releases. This potential problem is mentioned in this submission for
transparency.

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or detailed) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: The focus on neutralization causes some overlap with CWE-74
(involving neutralization and downstream components) and CWE-20 (with
its focus on validation of input alone). This submission will be
changed to focus only on validation.

Response: Changed name and desc for focus solely on "validation".


SUB.COORD - "Requires extensive coordination"

Description: The submission will require or is currently undergoing close
coordination, discussion, and debate between multiple parties with
different perspectives and opinions.  The communication could be taking
place in CDR itself, or outside of CDR.  As a result, it might take longer
to move the submission to later phases, although the submission is expected
to be more robust and well-defined as a result of this coordination.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient consensus has been reached, or if
the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.

Comments: This submission is being actively developed by the CWE AI WG
during July 2024 in the attempt to add it to CWE 4.15 (July 16),
including meetings and possibly discussions on CDR.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


SUB.NEWTECH - "New/Emerging Technology"

Description: The submission is related to a new or emerging technology that
is not well-understood from a weakness perspective, which can cause real or
perceived gaps in CWE that require extra effort and time to analyze.
Typically, for new/emerging technologies, early vulnerability discovery and
research does not focus on root cause analysis (i.e., weakness
identification). Instead, the focus is on other areas such as attacks and
exploitation methods, technical impacts, threats, mitigations, or other
concerns.  As a result, industry understanding can be limited, effectively
requiring research or focused efforts by SMEs to understand the underlying
weaknesses.  Rapidly-changing, diverse terminology and technology can
further complicate understanding. Finally, there might not be enough
real-world examples with sufficient details from which weakness patterns
may be discovered.  For this reason, it can be difficult to determine
whether CWE entries already cover the topics of concern, and which gaps (if
any) exist.  As of May 2024, some new or emerging technologies include
AI/ML, cryptocurrency/blockchain, post-quantum cryptography, and
large-scale architectures with many components that have different trust
boundaries.  In previous years, new/emerging domains for CWE included
hardware, cloud, and ICS/OT.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient attempts have been made to
understand the weaknesses commonly seen in new or emerging technologies, or
if the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.  Analysis
could include analyzing well-known attacks to understand the weaknesses
that enable the attacks to succeed; analysis of mitigations to understand
how the underlying weaknesses are perceived; and/or other methods.  Such
analysis might require consultation with a variety of Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs).

Comments: This submission is related to AI/ML, which is not well
understood from a weakness perspective.
