NAME: Unintended operation of the application results in a threat to the user

DESCRIPTION:

It can be exploited by bad actor in phising attacks, as well as in general
with social engineering. But the main point is that there can be situation
where webapp is like bad actor. Example: automatic translation service is
translating website address as well as other plain text, it provide to
result like "example.com" is "przyklad.com" (case English-Polish), please
notice that translated website address is totally different one. Example:
automatic translation is translating email addresses similar like for
example about website address: address@example.com vs adres@przyklad.com.
The consequences may be dire. Please notice that it is not about just
translating only these cases, but case where these important (external
website address or email address) are concluded inside translated content.
User can be in hurry and copy translated results (large text with incorrect
and malicious results). Proposed solution - proper regex for parts which
shoudn't be translated.
