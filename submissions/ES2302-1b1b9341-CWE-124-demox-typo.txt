NAME: Correction of typo in CWE-124 Example 2

DESCRIPTION:

To Whom It May Concern:

I notice that in CWE-124 Example 2, the code given is:
```
int main() {
...
strncpy(destBuf, &srcBuf[find(srcBuf, ch)], 1024); ...
}
```

But after checking the implementation of libc, I think strncpy does
not perform any write operation on the second parameter. So I wonder
whether it is a typo, and the correct version should be:

```
int main() {
...
strncpy(&destBuf[find(destBuf, ch)], srcBuf, 1024); ...
}
```

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward
to hearing from you soon.

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: After a careful look at CWE-124, libc's strncpy(), find(),
and related materials, the CWE team feels that the example in question
exhibits CWE-127: Buffer Under-read, since the result from find() is
being used to read from srcBuf. So, we will move that code to a
demonstrative example for CWE-127.

We believe that the proposed code change is valid for CWE-124, but we
will change the explanations to make the example easier to understand.

Finally, the code should be labeled as C++, not C, due to the use of
find(). Please let us know if you agree with this approach.
