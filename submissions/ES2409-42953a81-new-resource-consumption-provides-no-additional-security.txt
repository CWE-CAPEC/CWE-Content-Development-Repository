NAME: Resource Consumption Provides No Additional Security 

DESCRIPTION:

The product implements an algorithm improperly, which causes the algorithm
to remain effective but not efficient. The improper implementation makes
the algorithm significantly more resource-intensive without providing
additional security which enables the attacker to cause unnecessary
resource consumption thereby performing a denial of service attack.
