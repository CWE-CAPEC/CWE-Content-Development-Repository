NAME: Improper Neutralization of ANSI Codes ('ANSI Injection')

DESCRIPTION:

With interactive command line interfaces becoming more commonplace with
growing system administration needs and human-friendly TUIs, logging
user-generated values into the terminal into one of these sessions is no
longer safe. ANSI codes that can not only change the color of console
output but can also arbitrarily move the cursor, clear the screen, and make
fake prompts present a danger to the integrity of prompts delivered by the
code inside the interactive CLI and by malicious user input. With a max
score of 8.8/10 on the CVSS ranking, its main application comes from
interactive permission prompts. For example, (CVE-2024-27936) if malicious
user input is added inline inside a permission prompt (i.e the interactive
prompt asks "Can this program run command <user input>," the user input,
with the usage of ANSI codes, can clear the prompt behind it and make a
misleading prompt that asks for an inconspicuous permission. This is a
subcategory of CWE-150, but there are enough CVEs present in this
subcategory (CVE-2003-0020, CVE-2003-0083, CVE-2003-0021, CVE-2003-0022,
CVE-2003-0023, CVE-2003-0063, CVE-2000-0476) to justify this category.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: The submission specifically focuses on ANSI codes. CWE-150,
already covers Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences. 
ASNI codes would be classified as "Control Sequences" which is why 
it is covered by CWE-150. Given that CWE-150 is already a variant 
abstraction, the proposed submission is likely to be too low level 
for a new entry. It may be better suited as a modification of CWE-150. 
Please also note that your suggestions of CVE-2003-0020, 
CVE-2003-0083, CVE-2003-0021, and some other observed examples are already 
listed in CWE-150.

----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Because this submission occurs at such a low level
(SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL), it might be better to treat this submission as a
modification to other entries (e.g. CWE-150) instead of a separate
new entry. Further discussion and identification of the core weakness
will help determine the appropriate action. Please indicate if you agree
or disagree with this comment.
