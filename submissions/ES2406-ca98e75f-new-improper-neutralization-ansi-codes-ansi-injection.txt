NAME: Improper Neutralization of ANSI Codes ('ANSI Injection')

DESCRIPTION:

With interactive command line interfaces becoming more commonplace with
growing system administration needs and human-friendly TUIs, logging
user-generated values into the terminal into one of these sessions is no
longer safe. ANSI codes that can not only change the color of console
output but can also arbitrarily move the cursor, clear the screen, and make
fake prompts present a danger to the integrity of prompts delivered by the
code inside the interactive CLI and by malicious user input. With a max
score of 8.8/10 on the CVSS ranking, its main application comes from
interactive permission prompts. For example, (CVE-2024-27936) if malicious
user input is added inline inside a permission prompt (i.e the interactive
prompt asks "Can this program run command <user input>," the user input,
with the usage of ANSI codes, can clear the prompt behind it and make a
misleading prompt that asks for an inconspicuous permission. This is a
subcategory of CWE-150, but there are enough CVEs present in this
subcategory (CVE-2003-0020, CVE-2003-0083, CVE-2003-0021, CVE-2003-0022,
CVE-2003-0023, CVE-2003-0063, CVE-2000-0476) to justify this category.
