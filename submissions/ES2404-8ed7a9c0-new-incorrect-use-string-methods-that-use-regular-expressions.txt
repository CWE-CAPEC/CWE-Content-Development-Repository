NAME: Incorrect use of String methods that use regular expressions

DESCRIPTION:

The methods are replaceAll, replaceFirst, matches, and split, of the
java.util.String object, they have a regular expression as their first
input parameter. If this parameter is part of an expression that comes from
input data, ReDoS attacks could be carried out. Likewise, if the parameter
is not escaped properly, IllegalArgumentException exceptions could be
forced which, if not considered, could alter the business logic and force
states not contemplated by the application.
The case of the replaceAll method is more dangerous, because its second
parameter, if not escaped properly, even without being a regular
expression, would also cause an IllegarArgumentException.
To avoid all these unsafe code solutions, it is recommended to use
Matcher.quoteReplacement(java.lang.String) in all input parameters to the
java.lang.String methods indicated above.
