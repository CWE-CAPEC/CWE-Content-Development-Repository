NAME: Incorrect use of String methods that use regular expressions

DESCRIPTION:

The methods are replaceAll, replaceFirst, matches, and split, of the
java.util.String object, they have a regular expression as their first
input parameter. If this parameter is part of an expression that comes from
input data, ReDoS attacks could be carried out. Likewise, if the parameter
is not escaped properly, IllegalArgumentException exceptions could be
forced which, if not considered, could alter the business logic and force
states not contemplated by the application.
The case of the replaceAll method is more dangerous, because its second
parameter, if not escaped properly, even without being a regular
expression, would also cause an IllegarArgumentException.
To avoid all these unsafe code solutions, it is recommended to use
Matcher.quoteReplacement(java.lang.String) in all input parameters to the
java.lang.String methods indicated above.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   ChildOf CWE-1333
   ChildOf CWE-20
   ChildOf CWE-95

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: Please clarify if you are specifically talking about user
input being used to construct the actual regular expression argument,
the replace string, or the string that the replaceAll() function is
being called on.  Our current interpretation of the main weakness is:
"not neutralizing special regex-processing elements in strings during
regular expression operations." Let us know if you agree with this
interpretation.

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The proposed entry is similar to CWE-624. The main difference
lies in the fact that the proposed entry uses a Java specific example.
Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The proposed entry highlights CWE-1333, CWE-20, and CWE-95
as related CWEs. CWE-1333 may be resultant from this weakness. CWE-20
is one type of "neutralization" that could ensure that no regex
operators are present in the input. It appears that CWE-624 is more
aligned to cover the regular expressions parameter being used as an
input, so there might be some overlap. In general, CWE-116 (improper
encoding) and CWE-138 (for neutralization of special elements) seem to
apply more closely.  Additionally, CWE-755 and similar may also be
associated, given the use of IllegalArgumentException, although this
might be a chaining issue.  The CWE team needs to better understand
the issue as it likely affects different subtrees within the
CWE. Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or detailed) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: Assuming that our interpretation of the weakness is correct
(see SUB.UNCLEAR), this weakness could be classified under both
CWE-116 (improper encoding) and CWE-138 (for neutralization of special
elements). The relationship between these CWEs and their subtrees is
not as clearly defined as it could be. The CWE Team will work
separately to try and address these problems. This will not prevent
moving your submission forward through this process. Please
acknowledge that you have read this comment.
