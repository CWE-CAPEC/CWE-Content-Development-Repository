ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The distinction between CWE-601 and this issue isn't
highlighted. How do the images and QR present a weakness in addition
to CWE-601? Further details are needed to better understand the
underlying weakness. Alternately, this could be an example of an
attack, so it might be more appropriate for CAPEC.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This issue specifically calls out images, which is likely to
be too low-level. Ideally, this would be added to CWE-601.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: SUB.RELREFS is applied because the submission cites
Wikipedia and CWE as references, but neither of these specifically
describes the role of images and QR codes. Please provide a reference
that specifically discusses this issue.
