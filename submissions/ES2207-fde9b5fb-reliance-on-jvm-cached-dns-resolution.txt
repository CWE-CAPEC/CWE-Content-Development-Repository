NAME: Reliance on a dynamic, critical cached reference

DESCRIPTION: 

There are a number of JVM implementations that by default, cache DNS
resolution results. The expiry setting of the cached results might
either be inappropriately long for the program or set to never expire.
This results in a situation where changes to DNS records seemingly do
not take effect in the program. Upon restarting the program, the
updated DNS records are available to the program.

To mitigate this situation, the DNS cache setting
networkaddress.cache.ttl for the JVM need to be set appropriately.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: In a previous round, the CWE Team stated that "JVMs are too
specific [but] it might be reasonable to create a weakness about
caches (or other types of resources) that are stored too long (i.e.,
do not expire fast enough), and this JVM/DNS issue could be cited as
an example." CWE-664 and potential subtree reorganization were
recommended. The submitter agreed and suggested a different name,
"Reliance on a cached reference that is dynamic and critical". The CWE
Team agrees that this name is sufficient for this phase, although it
might need additional changes to reflect concepts such as
expiration. CWE will work with the submitter in later stages to
further improve the resulting new entry. Please state if you agree
with this approach.

----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: The CWE Team plans to accept this submission, completing
Stage 1.  However, since the abstraction of the resulting new CWE
entry will become more general than the original submission, the CWE
Team will coordinate with the submitter to determine how much they are
willing to collaborate on this new entry in Stage 2 (detailed
submission). Please let us know if you agree with this approach.
