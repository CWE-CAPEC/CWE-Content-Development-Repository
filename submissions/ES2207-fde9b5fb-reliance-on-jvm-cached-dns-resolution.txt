NAME: Inadvertent reliance on JVM cached DNS resolution

DESCRIPTION: 

There are a number of JVM implementations that by default, cache DNS
resolution results. The expiry setting of the cached results might
either be inappropriately long for the program or set to never expire.
This results in a situation where changes to DNS records seemingly do
not take effect in the program. Upon restarting the program, the
updated DNS records are available to the program.

To mitigate this situation, the DNS cache setting
networkaddress.cache.ttl for the JVM need to be set appropriately.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: JVMs are too specific to have a separate CWE entry for
them. However, it might make sense to create a weakness about caches
(or other types of resources) that do not expire fast enough, and the
which the JVMs and DNS could be cited as an example. Such an entry
would fall underneath CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through
its Lifetime, and some additional subtree reorganization might be
needed.
