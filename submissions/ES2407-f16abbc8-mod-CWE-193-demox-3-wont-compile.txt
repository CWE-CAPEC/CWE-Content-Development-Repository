RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: We agree with the finding. We need to adjust the following in the code:

- getc() needs a parameter like stdin.
- if (c == 'EOF') is incorrect. EOF is a macro, not a string, so it should be checked as if (c == EOF) without quotes.
- missing declaration for i. make i an int.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; ISSUE RESOLVED]
