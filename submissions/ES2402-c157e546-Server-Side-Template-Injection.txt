NAME: Server-Side Template Injection Remote Code Execution

DESCRIPTION:

Mandiant found that the affected application was vulnerable to Server-Side
Template Injection (u201cSSTIu201d), with the possibility of performing
Remote Code Execution (u201cRCEu201d). Misconfigured or outdated templating
libraries or unsafe concatenation of user input can lead to an attacker
being able to inject templating control characters, thereby executing
arbitrary code on the 
server. Many template engines support complex expressions inside template
tags, which could allow an attacker to use standard library functions to
gain access to operating system 
commands or to read sensitive information accessible by the application.
