NAME: Server-Side Template Injection Remote Code Execution

DESCRIPTION:

Mandiant found that the affected application was vulnerable to Server-Side
Template Injection (u201cSSTIu201d), with the possibility of performing
Remote Code Execution (u201cRCEu201d). Misconfigured or outdated templating
libraries or unsafe concatenation of user input can lead to an attacker
being able to inject templating control characters, thereby executing
arbitrary code on the 
server. Many template engines support complex expressions inside template
tags, which could allow an attacker to use standard library functions to
gain access to operating system 
commands or to read sensitive information accessible by the application.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: It is not clear what modifications are being proposed, as
Server-Side Template Injection is covered in CWE-1336 already. The
"Server-Side Template Injection" phrase is included in Alternate
Terms. "Remote Code Execution" is a technical impact that is already
covered in Common Consequences under "Execute Unauthorized Code or
Commands", although this submission's description provides some more
specific details. The use of "complex expressions" as stated in this
submission's description is already alluded to by the phrase "invoke
arbitrary expressions" in the second paragraph in the Extended
Description. Please clarify what changes in CWE-1336 you would like to
see.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: Since the submission does not appear to provide any new
information, the CWE Team might need to decline it, unless the
submitter can be more specific about what changes are being
proposed. If you have more specific suggestions, please provide them
in the "Response:" in the SUB.ACTION problem above.
