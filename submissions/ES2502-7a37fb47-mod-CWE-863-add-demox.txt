NAME: Add demonstrative example to CWE-863

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code for Java language for the given
description:

Demonstrative Examples:

````
String role = request.getCookies("role");  

if (role == null) {
    role = getUserRole("guest"); 
    response.addCookie(new Cookie("role", role));
}

if (role.equals("Admin")) {
    deleteUser(request.getParameter("userID"));
} else {
    response.getWriter().println("Unauthorized access!");
}


````

In this Java code, an attacker can manually set the "role" cookie to
"Admin" and gain unauthorized access to the deleteUser() function, allowing
them to delete any user without proper authentication

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: This example is reasonable, but we will need to add more details. 
In Stage 2, we will work with you to refine this example to fit with CWE's 
expected style, such as introductory text and a "good code" example to 
demonstrate the fix. Additionally, this example can also be used for
CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking 
in a Security Decision. Please confirm that you acknowledge the comment 
and that you are OK with us using this example for CWE-784 too.
