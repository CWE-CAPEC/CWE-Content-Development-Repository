NAME: Improper Authorization - used user ID

DESCRIPTION:

Some services like surveys are called anonymous, when in fact they are not.
Bad actor can easy change parameter like user_id and send a message as
another user. Impact: bad actor may make it worse relationship
company-user/company - lost of trust and reputation. It is more dangerous
when survey are using textFields with open answers - can write there
bad/forbidden things as other person. POC - recently I've got an invitation
from well-known org (called here first company) - they used survey from
also well-known org/company (called here second company). The issue is -
survey is called anonymous, when with parameter is used '&user_id=[number]'
- bad actor can check IDs for customers of first company and send (change)
as other people - first company will get answers and this can make worse a
relationship between them (first company and their customers). In fact it
is also bad even if survey are using just combobox answers - because still
bad actor can send an answers as other people.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The weakness described in this submission seems to be identical to
IDOR - CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key.  In both this
submission and CWE-639, access is given to a user's data simply by providing a
key to bypass authorization.  This submission describes a specific case related
to anonymous surveys, but that is not unique from CWE-639.  Please let us know
if you agree with this assessment or if you believe there is still an additional
weakness not covered through CWE-639.

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The submission does not provide any references to back up
the described weakness.  If the submission is identified to indeed be
a duplicate of CWE-639 as described by SUB.OVERLAP, then this
submission will likely be closed and the references would not be
needed.
