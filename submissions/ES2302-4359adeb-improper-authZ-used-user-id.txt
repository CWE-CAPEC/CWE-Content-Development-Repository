NAME: Improper Authorization - used user ID

DESCRIPTION:

Some services like surveys are called anonymous, when in fact they are not.
Bad actor can easy change parameter like user_id and send a message as
another user. Impact: bad actor may make it worse relationship
company-user/company - lost of trust and reputation. It is more dangerous
when survey are using textFields with open answers - can write there
bad/forbidden things as other person. POC - recently I've got an invitation
from well-known org (called here first company) - they used survey from
also well-known org/company (called here second company). The issue is -
survey is called anonymous, when with parameter is used '&user_id=[number]'
- bad actor can check IDs for customers of first company and send (change)
as other people - first company will get answers and this can make worse a
relationship between them (first company and their customers). In fact it
is also bad even if survey are using just combobox answers - because still
bad actor can send an answers as other people.
