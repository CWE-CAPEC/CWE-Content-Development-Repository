NAME: IV is derived from key  with CBC Mode

DESCRIPTION:

IV is derived from Key, which causes IV to remain unchanged in the same
session, resulting in CWE-329.
However, in the special case of IV=key, CCA attacks will be caused. The
attacker only needs to send the specified ciphertext after construction to
obtain the key through the decrypted content.
The specific attack process is as follows:

Intercept ciphertext: The attacker intercepts a ciphertext that is
encrypted using IV = Key. C = (C1, C2, C3,... , Cn).
Construct a special ciphertext: The attacker constructs a new ciphertext C'
= (C1, 0, C1, C2, C3,... , Cn), where 0 represents a block of all zeros.
Decryption process: When decrypting C1, P1 = AES_decrypt(C1, Key) XOR Key.
When decrypting the second block, P2 = AES_decrypt(0, Key) XOR C1. When
decrypting the third block, P3 = AES_decrypt(C1, Key) XOR 0. Recovery Key:
Since P1 = AES_decrypt(C1, Key) XOR Key and P3 = AES_decrypt(C1, Key), P1
XOR P3 = Key.
