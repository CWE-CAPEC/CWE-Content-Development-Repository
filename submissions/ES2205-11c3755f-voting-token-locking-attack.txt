NAME: Concurrent election voting token locking attack

DESCRIPTION: 

Blockchains and smart contracts that allow multiple concurrent votes
to take place and use token locking to attach tokens and take them out
of circulation are vulnerable to token locking attacks. If an attacker
can create an initial election and then a second concurrent election
the attacker can entice users of the system to vote in the first
election, locking their tokens in, making them unavailable to vote in
the second election until the first election ends.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness".  Submission's name and/or
description does not clearly identify a weakness, or it is written in
a way that is vague and could cause the submission to be incorrectly
mapped to.

Comment: after 2022-08-30 modifications, it is still unclear what the
specific mistake is. Is it that multiple elections are allowed to
occur simultaneously? Or is there some (unstated) weakness that allows
concurrent elections to occur in the first place?  Neither option is
spelled out as a specific mistake. See SUB.ATTACK commentary.

Response: <submitter should reply here>

----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused". Submission's name and/or
description emphasizes the attack, not the weakness. Either the
submission's weakness is not well-understood, or it is better
described as an attack pattern, which may be suitable for inclusion in
CAPEC. Resolution: an initial submission cannot progress to later
stages unless it already includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not
subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comment: the new name and description (submitted 2022-08-30) are still
attack focused, as indicated by the use of the word "attack." Both
name and description say "attack". Desc says "if an attacker can
create a second election... the attacker can create an initial
election."  However, this is a precondition for a vulnerability. There
is still no indication of the mistake that makes the technology
subject to "token locking attacks". If the weakness cannot be
identified, consider submitting this issue to CAPEC.

Response: <submitter should reply here>

----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap". Submission might
identify an issue for which there could be a broader gap or
organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE subtree
relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Comment: Suspected issue, awaiting resolution of SUB.UNCLEAR. See
SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL.

Response: <not necessary until SUB.UNCLEAR is resolved>


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction". Submission identifies a
weakness, but its abstraction might be too low-level to merit its own
CWE entry. If it is focused on a particular technology, framework,
protocol, or function, then it might not be unique enough to get its
own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of an existing entry to
include the additional details, or creation of a higher-level entry
for which the submission is one example. (Note: some older CWE entries
have this problem and would not be published today, generally because
they were too specific to a particular language.)

Comment: Due to SUB.UNCLEAR, this issue is uncertain. The desc is
focused on "blockchains and smart contracts" although the name
references "voting". Maybe there is a broader range of technologies or
frameworks to which this attack or weakness applies.

Response: <not necessary until SUB.UNCLEAR is resolved>


----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships". Submission suggests some
relationships, but the name/description is not explained in a way in
which the relationship is relevant.

Comment: Relationships still remain unclear until name/desc are
updated.

Response: <not necessary until SUB.UNCLEAR is resolved>


----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem". Submission has some other
problem that is not covered elsewhere.

Comment: 2022-08-30 modification to name/desc does not address the
following concern as originally included in the request for
consultation on 2022-07-12: provided reference mentions DAOs and
"quorum voting" but neither phrase is included in desc/name. This
might provide the clarity needed for SUB.UNCLEAR. Also might provide
suggestions for SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL.

Response: <submitter should reply here>



----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues". Submission has multiple
occurrences of errors with grammar, spelling, etc. that should be
fixed before publication.

Comment: grammar issues resolved in 2022-08-30 update. This problem
will remain active until a clear weakness is identified.

Response: <not necessary until SUB.UNCLEAR is resolved>

----------

SCOPE.SITUATIONS - "Focus on situations in which weaknesses may appear". The
submission focuses on the conditions or situations in which weaknesses
are more likely to appear. Rationale: these are modes of introduction,
which is a separate field in a CWE entry.

Comment: possibly a result of attack-focused nature of current
name/desc.

Response: <not necessary until SUB.UNCLEAR is resolved>


RESOLVED ISSUES:

SCOPE.NOTREAL - "not a real-world issue". The issue has not happened
and cannot happen within real-world software or other electronic
logic, and/or has no actual security implications.

Comment: despite the controversy of some implementations of
blockchain-based technologies, "blockchain" and "smart contracts"
constitute software/electronic logic, and the real-world financial
implications are frequently cited as part of the controversy.
Therefore, this submission is not subject to SCOPE.NOTREAL.

----------

SCOPE.CUSTREL - "not customer-relevant". The issue is not relevant to the
threat model or security concerns of the product's owner/operator
(i.e., the customer).

Comment: financial impact to users of this technology are well-known,
so related weaknesses or attack patterns are
customer-relevant. Therefore, this submission is not subject to
SCOPE.CUSTREL.
