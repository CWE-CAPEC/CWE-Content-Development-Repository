NAME: Inconsistent Email Normalization Leading to Authentication Bypass

DESCRIPTION:

Observation:
This vulnerability arises due to inconsistent email normalization between
the authentication system and database checks. When users sign up for a
trial, the application verifies whether an email has been used before.
However, it fails to properly normalize email addresses, allowing
variations with symbols such as "+" (e.g., user@example.com vs.
user+1@example.com) to be treated as different users.

1. We registered for a trial account using a business or student email.
2. When an already-used email was entered, the system rejected the request
with a "trial was not approved" message.
3. We then modified the same email by appending a "+" alias (e.g.,
user+1@example.com) and completed the registration process.
4. The system accepted the modified email and sent a confirmation email.
5. Upon verifying the email, we successfully gained access to the trial.
6. Using the provided credentials, we logged into the web application and
downloaded the trial license key.
We tested the key and confirmed that it unlocked the full pro version of
the software.



Root Cause Analysis:
- The email verification system normalizes email addresses inconsistently
between the authentication process and the database check.
- While the email server correctly identifies aliases (e.g.,
user+1@example.com as user@example.com), the application treats them as
unique accounts.
- This inconsistency allows users to circumvent trial restrictions by
manipulating email addresses, creating multiple trial accounts under a
single email identity.

Impact:
The vulnerability has multiple security and financial implications,
including:
- Financial Loss: Attackers can continuously access premium services for
free, leading to revenue loss as legitimate customers may opt to abuse the
trial instead of purchasing a valid license.
- Unauthorised Redistribution: Since the trial keys can be obtained
multiple times, an attacker may distribute or resell the keys on
third-party platforms, further impacting the organisationu2019s sales.
- Reputation Damage: If trial keys are widely shared or sold on the black
market, it could undermine the perceived value of the premium offering,
eroding customer trust.
- Increased Operational Costs: Abuse of the trial system could result in
increased server loads and unnecessary customer support inquiries,
affecting business operations.

Recommended:
To mitigate this issue, we strongly recommend implementing strict email
validation to prevent aliasing techniques such as adding +1 to existing
emails. Normalising email inputs before processing registrations can
effectively block this method of abuse. 
- Enforce strict email normalization before storing and verifying emails,
ensuring that aliases (such as + tags) are removed before checking for
duplicates.
- Use secondary verification methods such as OTP, CAPTCHA, or payment
details to prevent abuse.
- Monitor for abnormal registration behavior using logging and
rate-limiting mechanisms.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The current submission is too attack focused because it focuses on the technical
impact which is "authentication bypass" and also explains a proof of concept attack.  In order
to make the submission more general, it should focus on the weakness that is occurring, which is
that the incoming email address is not being properly normalized. There are other technical impacts
that could arise from improper normalization, so if the submission is changed to focus more on the 
email address normalization it will encompass more scenarios.  Please indicate if you agree with 
focusing solely on improper normalization and consider suggesting an alternate description that 
aligns with this suggestion.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The currently suggested relationships do not seem to be the
best fit for if the submission focuses solely on improper
normalization.  The CWE team suggests the following relationships for
consideration.  It seems like CWE-706: "Use of Incorrectly-Resolved
Name or Reference" would be the best fit for a parent.  The act of
improper normalization is very similar to CWE-41: "Improper Resolution
of Path Equivalence", so it would make sense for them to both have the
same parent.  CWE-289: "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name" could
be considered as a "CanFollow" relationship which would capture the
attack scenario currently described by the submission.  CWE-180:
"Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Canonicalize" appears to be
the only CWE entry that discusses canonlicalization (or normalization)
although it doesn't fit exactly to the more general improper
normalization.  Please indicate if you agree with creating a child CWE
entry under CWE-706: "Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference"
for something like "Improper Normalization of Name or Reference"

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The current reference is the same text as the submission
description, but also adds a specific proof of concept for a current
product.  Because the reference shows a specific proof of concept, it
would be more fitting for a CVE entry.  For this CWE entry, we should
find references that describe how to properly normalize things such as
URLs, email addresses, or path names.  Please indicate if you agree
with this assessment and provide other references, if you know of any.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission is similar to the one proposed in
ES2302-0697c4d4 (CDR #64).  Therefore, the CWE team will treat both
submissions at the same time, possibly combining them if
appropriate. Note that both submitters would receive credit.
