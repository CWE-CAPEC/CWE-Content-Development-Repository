NAME: Application State Type Corruption (ASTC) - Persistent Data Type Assumptions in PHP Applications

DESCRIPTION:

This weakness occurs when an application assumes that persisted data
structures will always conform to an expected type (e.g., objects) without
validating the retrieved state. In some cases, the application itself may
unintentionally mutate or convert the stored data into a different type
(e.g., arrays instead of objects) during normal processing. Subsequent code
that accesses properties or methods assumes the original type, leading to
persistent fatal errors across multiple modules. This can result in
authentication failures, system crashes, or other systemic failures.
Variations include any situation where unsafe assumptions about type
integrity are made across execution paths and persistent state mutation is
possible.
