NAME: Modify CWE-639 alt terms for IDOR and BOLA

DESCRIPTION:

In CWE-639, in the "Alternate Terms" field, there is a reference to Broken
Object Level Authorization (BOLA), stating that in the 2019 OWASP API
Security Top 10 documents, BOLA and IDOR are considered the same thing.
However, during my research, I analyzed both the 2019 OWASP API Security
Top 10 documentation and other sources that indicate possibilities that
IDOR and BOLA are the same thing, and I found no such claim. On the
contrary, in my research, I explain the main differences between the two,
with reference to OWASP itself.

The link to my article can be accessed here
https://medium.com/@0ta/unraveling-vulnerabilities-understanding-the-difference-between-idor-bac-and-bola-0bc52cbc6dde

This information is covered in the article in the field "Insecure Direct
Object Reference (IDOR) vs. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)" and 
"Differences in the Use of the Term u201cObjectu201d in Relation to IDOR
and BOLA"


Consider changing the phrase 'BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security
Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR' to either:

1 - 'BOLA is included in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10; however,
according to OWASP documentation, it is not the same as IDOR.'

or

2 - 'BOLA is listed in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10.'"

This provides clarity and precision in the information.
