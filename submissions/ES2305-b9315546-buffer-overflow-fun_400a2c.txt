NAME: Buffer Overflow:  FUN_400a2c

DESCRIPTION:

Buffer overflows happen when a program attempts to write more data to a
buffer than it can hold, or when a program attempts to write data at an
offset that is outside the boundaries of the buffer. The most common cause
of buffer overflows is copying data to a buffer without setting an upper
bound on the length of the data being copied. The analysis detected a
potentially insecure use of strcpy(). The source buffer passed into the
call can be arbitrarily large, and copying it into fixed-length arrays
without first determining the size and allocating adequate storage can
result in a buffer overflow.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: It is not clear what change is intended by this
submission. The proposed description seems to be a rephrase of the
current extended description, adding in a specific detail about
strcpy(). What change is being proposed?

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.IPR - "IP Rights Concerns"

Description: The submission might have concerns related to intellectual
property rights, e.g., by citing or deriving content from sources that are
subject to significant restrictions, or if the content is copied verbatim
from a source without attribution (i.e., plagiarism).

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until it is
clear that there are no IP concerns.

Comments: Some of this submission might have been taken from a code
analysis and/or reverse engineering tool. The "FUN_400a2c" in the name
seems like it would be from some reverse engineering tool. Part of the
paragraph says "The analysis detected a potentially insecure use of
strcpy()" which suggests that some kind of report is being cited. If
this text has been taken from a tool - which tool did this come from?
Is this phrasing already protected by copyright?

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: It would be too low-level to create a new CWE entry that is
specific to strcpy(), so this submission is assumed to be a suggested
modification to CWE-120. Please confirm.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The only reference is to CWE's web page for CWE-120. Is
there another reference that could be suggested? If the submitter is
only suggesting changes to the description or extended description,
then it is not necessary to provide additional references.
