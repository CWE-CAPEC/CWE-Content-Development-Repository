NAME: PWE-3: Multiple ways to search for start or end of data structure object leading to confusion

DESCRIPTION:

File formats specification often have identifying u2018magicu2019 markers
to identify the file format or the start and end of the format. Polygot
files exist whenever different file formats can co-exist in the same file.
Depending on the parser, each will parse the start location differently for
each format. For example, a polygot file can contain both a PDF and ZIP at
the same time. Beside the initial entry point, this weakness can encompass
locating the start or end of data structures within the data format. A
malicious actor can manipulate the file by modifying data structures such
that a parser may become confused and parse from the wrong start or end
location. This can happen because the parser is being overly lenient,
confusing error handling, unclear specification, or badly defined search
functions.
