NAME: Speculative propagation of requests for transaction before data validation in multi-manager bus architectures

DESCRIPTION:

In a multi-manager shared bus architecture, the on-chip interconnect based
on a protocol enforcing the ordering of requests and data indefinitely
locks the write access to a shared output link when a request for a write
transaction is not efficiently fulfilled by a manager module.

The interconnect propagates an address request before data validation. This
speculatively reserves the bus to the manager transaction issuer, which is
left free to delay its data provisioning phase. This can be exploited by a
malicious/faulty/misbehaving manager module to generate a condition of
denial-of-service in accessing the write data link from all of the other
managers in the system, and unboundedly inhibit the write access to one or
multiple peripherals in the system (i.e., memories, I/Os, etc.). 

A full description and investigation of the issue for one of the most
popular standards for on-chip communication deployed in modern systems on a
chip is reported in [1] and [2].

ACTIVE ISSUES:
----------

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: There are several questions in this comment that need to be
addressed.

(1) The name refers to a mistake, "Doing something before validating".
The name could be rewritten to match the CWE style of naming.

(2) What is a "manager module"? This is not mentioned in the
provided references.

(3) How is the term "speculatively" being used
here?  Is it the same as with SPECTRE / MELTDOWN?

(4) Please verify whether our understanding of the issue is correct:

- There is a shared bus that is accessible by multiple devices.

- These devices all can issue requests that utilize that bus.

- There is a protocol that manages the devices requests to said bus.

- When a device makes a request to the bus, the bus is unable to 
  receive other requests until the initiating device finishes 
  its transaction.

- If the initiating device decides not to finish the transaction, 
  this will cause a denial of service to the bus for the other
  devices.

One of the papers observes that AXI (as an example) "does not provide
a standard mechanism to supervise the behaviors (or misbehavior) of
the managers." Is this the core weakness being covered by this
submission?

Response: (1) Might something like "Improper request propagation
before data reception in write transactions" be more compliant? Feel
free to suggest any other title more compliant with the CWE naming
style.

(2) A manager module is defined as a hardware module capable of
initiating transactions on the bus through its manager
interface. Examples of manager modules are processors, DMAs, hardware
accelerators, etc. In the same way, we also use the terminology
"controller module".

(3) The meaning of speculative here is different from the meaning in
SPECTRE/MELTDOWN. The interconnect receives a write request from a
controller initiator (sending the header to the interconnect for
writing N words of data, with N ranging from 1 to the maximum burst
length allowed). The request is speculatively propagated by the
interconnect to the target peripheral through the shared bus before
the corresponding data are received at the interconnect. The
propagation of the header reserves to the initiator controller the
whole bus path between itself and the target peripheral until all of
the words associated with the request are provided by the
controller. Here the word "speculatively" refers to the fact that the
interconnect propagates the request assuming that the controller will
at some point provide the data, thus releasing the use of the
bus. Another way to see it is that the interconnect assumes a
cooperative behavior from the controller, thus implicitly trusting
that the controller will complete the transaction and release the bus
for the use from the other controllers.

(4) Your assumptions are correct. I wish to add that the core issue
relies on a combination of two factors: (i) lack of specification in
the on-chip communication standard (AXI in the case under analysis),
and (ii) the cut-through switching policy, a switching methodology for
high performance commonly implemented at the interconnect level. In
cut-through, a request is propagated independently on the receipt at
the interconnect level of the corresponding data. As mentioned in the
previous comment, if the controller issuing a write request delays the
provisioning of the corresponding data, the other controllers
experience delays in accessing the bus. Such delays are capable of
generating denial of service.

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The relationships for this weakness are not clear. If our
understanding of the submission is correct (see SUB.UNCLEAR), a close
match may be CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective
Lifetime.  We also considered possible association with CWE-179:
Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation, but CWE-772 seems more
appropriate.  Please let us know if you agree with this assessment.

Response: I agree that CWE-772 can be seen as correlated. However,
CWE-772 has a different peculiarity as in that case there is an
explicit release required by the initiator. Instead, in this specific
case, no explicit release is required from the initiator, rather, the
release is implicit after the propagation of the data corresponding to
the request.  I also agree that CWE-179 seems less correlated -- in
the submitted weakness there are no protection mechanisms against
dangerous inputs involved.

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This submission appears to be focused on a very specific
kind of technology. While the underlying weakness is not yet clearly
understood, it seems like it could apply across a range of
technologies. This submission might need to be generalized, unless it
is specific to bus architectures.

Response: In the references, the weakness is described in detail and
tested on the AXI standard. However, the weakness is associated with
general concepts such as cut-through switching and multi-channel bus
protocols rather than only with the specific standard under analysis
in the references. Please let me know if you agree with that and we
could work together on some modifications to make it more general and
compliant (if required).
