NAME: Speculative propagation of requests for transaction before data validation in multi-manager bus architectures

DESCRIPTION:

In a multi-manager shared bus architecture, the on-chip interconnect based
on a protocol enforcing the ordering of requests and data indefinitely
locks the write access to a shared output link when a request for a write
transaction is not efficiently fulfilled by a manager module.

The interconnect propagates an address request before data validation. This
speculatively reserves the bus to the manager transaction issuer, which is
left free to delay its data provisioning phase. This can be exploited by a
malicious/faulty/misbehaving manager module to generate a condition of
denial-of-service in accessing the write data link from all of the other
managers in the system, and unboundedly inhibit the write access to one or
multiple peripherals in the system (i.e., memories, I/Os, etc.). 

A full description and investigation of the issue for one of the most
popular standards for on-chip communication deployed in modern systems on a
chip is reported in [1] and [2].

ACTIVE ISSUES:
----------
SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The weakness described in this submission appears to be very similar to
CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation. Can you describe the how
your submission differs?
