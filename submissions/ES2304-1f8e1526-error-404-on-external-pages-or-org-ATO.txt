NAME: Error 404 on external pages - or just possibility to org/company ATO

DESCRIPTION:

It is org and companies duty to provide for users and clients checked
resources. Example: provided external site to social media account - result
404, bad actor can create account with this name (ATO). Example: provided
external site to social media account - result improper account (account
taken over).

This situation can be classified as a security issue, specifically a link
hijacking vulnerability, sometimes referred to as external link hijacking
or social media account hijacking.

This can be described as external link hijacking or more specifically,
social media handle hijacking. If an organization provides a link to a
social media account that doesn't exist (due to a typo or outdated handle),
a malicious actor can take over the invalid link by creating a fake account
with the same handle. As a result, users who click the link may be directed
to a fake profile controlled by the attacker, allowing them to potentially
impersonate the organization. 

This is a security risk because it could lead to several potential threats:

1. Brand Reputation Damage: If an attacker creates a malicious account
linked to the organization's name, they can post harmful or misleading
content that damages the organization’s reputation. Customers or partners
may think they are interacting with the official social media profile.

2. Phishing and Scams: Attackers could use the fake account to carry out
phishing attacks, pretending to be the organization and tricking users into
divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card
details, or personal data.

3. Fraudulent Engagement: The attacker could also promote fake promotions,
contests, or giveaways, leading users to fraudulent sites or persuading
them to send money or sensitive details, all while believing they are
interacting with the legitimate organization.

4. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Impact: Links from the organization’s
website can help boost the fake account’s visibility in search results.
This might make the fake account appear more credible, leading to higher
traffic and more potential victims.

5. Loss of Control: Once the typo link is hijacked, the organization loses
control of its presence in that specific social media platform until they
can reclaim the name (if possible). In some cases, it may be difficult to
recover the handle or account without significant effort.

For these reasons, it's important to correct any errors in social media
links to ensure that users are directed to official, verified accounts.

This falls under the category of external link hijacking or more
specifically social media link hijacking. When an organization incorrectly
links to a social media profile that doesn’t exist (due to a typo or
change in the handle), an attacker can create an account using the
incorrect username. This means users who click on the link from the
organization's official website will be directed to the fake account, which
could be used for malicious purposes.

By linking to a non-existent social media account, the organization risks
having an attacker claim that account and use it maliciously. Since users
trust the link from the organization's official page, they are more likely
to believe the fake profile is legitimate, creating opportunities for
phishing, scams, or brand impersonation. Thus, it is crucial to correct any
such errors to avoid security threats and safeguard the organization’s
digital presence.
