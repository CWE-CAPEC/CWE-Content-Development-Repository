NAME: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')

DESCRIPTION:

A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to
an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies
phishing attacks. Open Redirect allow also to immediately download a file
without user permission in some cases (because it is about redirection to
external site, some endpoints on external sites can trigger download
action).
