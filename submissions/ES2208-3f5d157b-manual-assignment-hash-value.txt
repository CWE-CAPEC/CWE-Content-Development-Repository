SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: Manual assignment of a hash value

DESCRIPTION:

Hash values are often used to provide validation of data and ensure
data structures are correct or unaltered with. If a hash value is
manually assigned, especially if it is a special value such as
\u201c0\u201d or \u201c00000000000\u201d it no longer represents the
actual derived hash value of that data (excluding a statistically
improbable chance that the manually entered value is indeed correct).
If this hash value is later relied upon in some way it can result in a
mismatch between what hash of the data should be and is.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This partially overlaps with CWE-328 because "Use of Weak Hash" focuses on this issue from an algorithm standpoint. However, the manual element is lacking in CWE-328, that can certainly be added to CWE-328 to make that more comprehensive. This doesn't need to be its own CWE.

----------
SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: The specificity provided through the issue deals with manual creation/usage of hash, which may be possible, and may warrant a discussion. However, that by itself becomes too detailed for a wider community, therefore, not widely relevant. The topic of manual hash generation/usage can be included in CWE-328 to make that entry more robust, without the need for making this issue a children of CWE-328 or another CWE.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------
SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: This applies because the issue highlighted doesn't warrant a "New Entry". The information provided is relevant to CWE-328, so "Modification" is more appropriate.
