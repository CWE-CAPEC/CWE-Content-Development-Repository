NAME: Insufficient Input Validation in Generative AI Applications

DESCRIPTION:

The product accepts user inputs for a generative artificial intelligence
application, which can modify or bypass the original instructions resulting
in an unintended response.

Extended Description: Without sufficient validation to application user
inputs, the generative artificial intelligence model can change its
original behavior or provide unintended responses. This can be used to
reveal model secrets, output biased responses, and possibly execute system
commands, depending on application capabilities.  This flaw depends on the
fact that generative artificial intelligence models make no real
distinction between the control and data planes.

Alternate term: prompt injection. Note to user: prompt injection is an
attack and applies to multiple weaknesses, not just this one.
