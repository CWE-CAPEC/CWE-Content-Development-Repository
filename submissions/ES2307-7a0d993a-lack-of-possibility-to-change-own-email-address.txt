NAME: Lack of possibility to change own email address

DESCRIPTION:

Applications should allow to user (account owner) to changing own email
address (ie. in account settings), especialy when it is part of credentials
or recover account mechanism. This is important in cases like data
compromised, where user's reaction/action should be quick and user should
have opportunity to change own email address, as part of protection of own
account. It is similar like possibility to change own password.

https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#Implement-Proper-Password-Strength-Controls

"Ensure credential rotation when a password leak occurs, or at the
time of compromise identification." - here, it can be a part of
credentials.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SCOPE.SITUATIONS - "Focus on situations in which weaknesses may appear"

Description: The submission focuses on conditions or situations in which
weaknesses are more likely to appear but are outside of the direct control
of the product.

Resolution: Submissions are likely to be rejected unless they can be recast
as categories or can influence modes of introduction of existing CWEs,
i.e., modify entries.

Comments: The proposed submission isn't clear in what the actual weakness is. 
It highlights that e-mails should be allowed to change when a compromise 
occurs. This is a situation and not an actual weakness. Vendors offer this
as a feature and not a bug. Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission emphasizes the inability to change an e-mail
address, and a separate submission (ES2307-69404299) focuses on
passwords. These submissions should probably be addressed at the same
time. The CWE Team will work with you to ensure that both submissions
address SUB.OVERLAP/SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL issues.  Please acknowledge this
comment.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This submission emphasizes the inability to change an e-mail
address, and a separate submission (ES2307-69404299) focuses on
passwords. If there are other kinds of data that should be able to be
changed, then it might be necessary to create a more-general entry
than what is covered by the current submissions. Please suggest if
other kinds of data (such as phone number) might be important to
cover.

----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that must be fixed before the Publication stage.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
move to the Publication stage without grammar and spelling checks. American
English is used for spelling.

Comments: The proposed submission doesn't follow proper American English style.
We suggest the following: "Applications should allow users 
(account owners) to change their own email addresses 
(e.g., in account settings), especially when the email 
address is part of the credentials or account recovery mechanism. 
This is important in cases where data may be compromised, 
since the user's response should be swift, and they should have the 
opportunity to change their email address as part of protecting their 
account. This functionality is similar to the ability to change 
one's own password." Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.
