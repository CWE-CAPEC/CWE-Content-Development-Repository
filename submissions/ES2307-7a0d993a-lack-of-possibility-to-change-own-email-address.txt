NAME: Lack of possibility to change own email address

DESCRIPTION:

Applications should allow to user (account owner) to changing own email
address (ie. in account settings), especialy when it is part of credentials
or recover account mechanism. This is important in cases like data
compromised, where user's reaction/action should be quick and user should
have opportunity to change own email address, as part of protection of own
account. It is similar like possibility to change own password.
