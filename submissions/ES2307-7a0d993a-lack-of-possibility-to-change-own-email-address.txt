NAME: Lack of possibility to change own email address

DESCRIPTION:

Applications should allow users (account owners) to change their own
email addresses (e.g., in account settings), especially when the email
address is part of the credentials or account recovery mechanism.
This is important in cases where data may be compromised, since the
user's response should be swift, and they should have the opportunity
to change their email address as part of protecting their
account. This functionality is similar to the ability to change one's
own password.

The inability to change email or password (credentials) in a web
application can be considered a vulnerability from both a security and
usability perspective. The main risks associated with this issue
include:

- Lack of Access Control: Users cannot update their credentials,
meaning they have no way to protect their accounts if they suspect
their credentials are compromised.

- Account Takeover Risk: If an attacker gains access to an account,
the legitimate user has no way to regain control or reset their
credentials, leading to permanent account loss.

- Account Management Challenges: Users cannot update their email
addresses, which may cause issues with password recovery or
receiving security-related notifications.

Providing functionality for users to change their passwords and email
addresses is crucial for ensuring account security and effective
account management in web applications.

Without an email change function, recovery and notifications may fail,
exacerbating security risks.  While availability impact is limited to
individual accounts, confidentiality and integrity impacts are severe.

It is important to clarify that the inability to change an email
address is indeed a security-related weakness. When an email address
is part of authentication credentials or recovery mechanisms,
restricting its modification can create vulnerabilities, especially in
cases of compromise. While vendors may offer this as a feature, the
lack of such functionality introduces risks and should be considered a
weakness.

Please consider the following scenarios (attacker gains access to a
compromised email address):

1. Even if the email is not used for the Reset/Account Recovery
function (e.g., password/PIN recovery via SMS) but is provided during
the registration process, if the user cannot change it, there remains
a risk of confidential information leakage when notifications are sent
to the unchanged email address.

2. The most common cases observed by the author: the Reset/Account
Recovery function relies on the provided email address. If the victim
cannot update or change the email address, they lose access to their
account.

3. The most common cases observed by the author: the email address is
used as part of the credentials during login. Similar to point 2, the
victim loses access to their account (the attacker can exploit this
vulnerability by accessing the unchanged email address, resetting and
setting a new password, or at the very least, obtaining information
sent via the product's notifications).

Many of us likely have different experiences, but based on my
observations, many products allow for password changes (which is good)
while simultaneously not allowing users to change the email address
that is used for logging in or account recovery functions. Cases where
the email address does not play a significant role in account
management are far less common in my experience.

In my opinion, the password change function becomes somewhat pointless
in scenarios where the email address cannot be changed. An attacker
can simply reset the password and gain persistence by using the
unchanged email address and setting a new password of their choice.

"Ensure credential rotation when a password leak occurs, or at the
time of compromise identification." - here, it can be a part of
credentials.

Relevant CWE Classifications:

- CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password

Although CWE-640 primarily deals with weak password recovery
mechanisms, the inability to change passwords or email addresses fits
into this context, as it prevents users from securing their accounts
properly.

- CWE-285: Improper Authorization

If the application prevents users from modifying their own
authentication credentials, it may reflect a lack of proper
authorization mechanisms for user data modification.

- CWE-359: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

If the inability to change a password leaves a potentially compromised
password active, it increases the risk of unauthorized account access.

- CWE-16: Configuration

This issue may also be classified as a configuration flaw, where a
critical function for user security is missing.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission emphasizes the inability to change an e-mail
address, and a separate submission (ES2307-69404299) focuses on
passwords. These submissions will be addressed at the same time as
part of a more general entry (see SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL). The CWE Team will
work with you to ensure that both submissions address
SUB.OVERLAP/SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL issues.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY; ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IN A LATER PHASE]


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This submission emphasizes the inability to change an e-mail
address, and a separate submission (ES2307-69404299) focuses on
passwords. Since there are other kinds of data that should be able to
be changed, the CWE Team plans to create a more-general entry than
what is covered by the current submissions.  Per 2025-01-18 reply by
the submitter, other data has been added to the description.

Please suggest if other kinds of data (such as phone number) might be
important to cover.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSSARY; ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IN A LATER PHASE]

Agree, good point. I suppose it might be necessary to create a
more-general entry.

I think it would be beneficial to present this in a more general way,
supported by the provided examples to illustrate the concept (so the
reader understands why the inability to update authentication data is
a weakness that an attacker could exploit).

Based on the author's experience, the following elements are commonly
associated with account management (registration, login, account
recovery):

- Email and password.

- Nickname/username and password (with recovery through email).

- Magic links sent via email, without a password.

- More frequently encountered in the context of 2FA, but it is also
  worth considering login methods involving: Phone numbers (e.g., SMS
  with a code sent to the registered phone number).

- Authorization codes from applications like Google Authenticator
  and similar OTP-based solutions.

This could be framed in a more general manner to account for potential
elements that may have been overlooked in the current description.

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SCOPE.SITUATIONS - "Focus on situations in which weaknesses may appear"

Description: The submission focuses on conditions or situations in which
weaknesses are more likely to appear but are outside of the direct control
of the product.

Resolution: Submissions are likely to be rejected unless they can be recast
as categories or can influence modes of introduction of existing CWEs,
i.e., modify entries.

Comments: The proposed submission isn't clear in what the actual weakness is. 
It highlights that e-mails should be allowed to change when a compromise 
occurs. This is a situation and not an actual weakness. Vendors offer this
as a feature and not a bug. Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

Response: [RESOLVED; DO NOT MODIFY. RELEVANT TEXT WAS COPIED TO THE
DESCRIPTION.]

The suggestion aligns with the context provided; however, it is
important to clarify that the inability to change an email address is
indeed a security-related weakness. When an email address is part of
authentication credentials or recovery mechanisms, restricting its
modification can create vulnerabilities, especially in cases of
compromise. While vendors may offer this as a feature, the lack of
such functionality introduces risks and should be considered a
weakness.

Please consider the following scenarios (attacker gains access to a
compromised email address):

1. Even if the email is not used for the Reset/Account Recovery
function (e.g., password/PIN recovery via SMS) but is provided during
the registration process, if the user cannot change it, there remains
a risk of confidential information leakage when notifications are sent
to the unchanged email address.

2. The most common cases observed by the author: the Reset/Account
Recovery function relies on the provided email address. If the victim
cannot update or change the email address, they lose access to their
account.

3. The most common cases observed by the author: the email address is
used as part of the credentials during login. Similar to point 2, the
victim loses access to their account (the attacker can exploit this
vulnerability by accessing the unchanged email address, resetting and
setting a new password, or at the very least, obtaining information
sent via the product's notifications).

Many of us likely have different experiences, but based on my
observations, many products allow for password changes (which is good)
while simultaneously not allowing users to change the email address
that is used for logging in or account recovery functions. Cases where
the email address does not play a significant role in account
management are far less common in my experience.

In my opinion, the password change function becomes somewhat pointless
in scenarios where the email address cannot be changed. An attacker
can simply reset the password and gain persistence by using the
unchanged email address and setting a new password of their choice.

I agree that this could be rephrased and generalized to account for
various alternative approaches. However, in my observations, the
mentioned cases are more common than their alternatives. I think it
would be valuable to highlight these examples in a section like
"Examples" to illustrate potential issues arising from weaknesses in
product design or implementation.

----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that must be fixed before the Publication stage.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
move to the Publication stage without grammar and spelling checks. American
English is used for spelling.

Comments: The proposed submission doesn't follow proper American English style.
We suggest the following: "Applications should allow users 
(account owners) to change their own email addresses 
(e.g., in account settings), especially when the email 
address is part of the credentials or account recovery mechanism. 
This is important in cases where data may be compromised, 
since the user's response should be swift, and they should have the 
opportunity to change their email address as part of protecting their 
account. This functionality is similar to the ability to change 
one's own password." Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.

Response: Agree. Sorry for that and thank you so much.
