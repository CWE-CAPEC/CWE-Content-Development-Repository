NAME: PWE-2: Non-deterministic boundary around data structure object definition

DESCRIPTION:

The complexity of certain file formats introduces ambiguities that may lead
to different interpretations on how to read and construct the model of the
document. The format specification inadvertently or does not proscribe
against undefined data cavities around or between data object structures.
In file formats that contain random access, references to data objects may
contain location calculations that leave openings between objects. This can
also occur in sequential file formats if boundaries are not clearly
defined. A side effect of cavities is hidden data. The data cavity may
contain untrusted code that the parser assume is trusted. Any parser code
that mishandles untrusted data due to lax boundary conditions can
potentially lead to an overflow and possibly code execution.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   Other CWE-231
   Other CWE-912

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: The submission highlights CWE-231 and CWE-912 as related
weaknesses.  CWE-912 doesn't appear to fit because the reference
discusses hiding malware in data cavities, which is different than
CWE-912. CWE-231 is not a good fit either because there is nothing
about extra values not being handled correctly. In a future phase,
further investigation is needed to determine appropriate
relationships. Please let us know if you agree with the suggestion.
