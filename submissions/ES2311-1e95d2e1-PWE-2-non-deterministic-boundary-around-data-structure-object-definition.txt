NAME: PWE-2: Non-deterministic boundary around data structure object definition

DESCRIPTION:

The complexity of certain file formats introduces ambiguities that may lead
to different interpretations on how to read and construct the model of the
document. The format specification inadvertently or does not proscribe
against undefined data cavities around or between data object structures.
In file formats that contain random access, references to data objects may
contain location calculations that leave openings between objects. This can
also occur in sequential file formats if boundaries are not clearly
defined. A side effect of cavities is hidden data. The data cavity may
contain untrusted code that the parser assume is trusted. Any parser code
that mishandles untrusted data due to lax boundary conditions can
potentially lead to an overflow and possibly code execution.
