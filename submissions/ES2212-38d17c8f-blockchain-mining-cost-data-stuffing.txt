NAME: Blockchain mining cost is insufficient to prevent data stuffing in blocks and long term DoS

DESCRIPTION:

In PoW, PoS and other blockchain systems the cost of mining a block of data
is set through technical and non-technical means. If the cost of mining a
block of data is sufficiently low an attacker can insert large volumes of
data into blocks that must be stored in perpetuity resulting in a
significant cost to nodes who must store and process all the data. This is
especially problematic in Blockchains that have low transaction volumes
(and thus typically small block sizes) but allow variable sized blocks that
can be much large to be mined.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The actual weakess isn't highlighted in the description or references provided. Yes, the attacker can insert large amounts of data if the cost of mining is low, but why is the cost of mining low, what is the actual weakness that attacker takes advantage of isn't called out. Additional information is needed to better understand the actual weakness.

----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The actual weakess isn't highlighted in the description or
references provided. The description and references focus on the Zcash
attack that occured without details on what was the actual weakness
that led to that attack. Additional information is needed to better
understand the actual weakness.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------
SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This applies because this issue only deals with blockchain
when the cost of mining is low - this appears to be a very rare
exception case. Additional information is needed to know how this
weakness applies in other blockchain scenarios, and what the actual
weakness is.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------
SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: Although it isn't necessary as part of Init-Review phase to
have proper references, the references provided simply point out the
Zcash attack that occured. No additional information is available on
what the weakness is and how that relates to creating a new entry on
this issue.
