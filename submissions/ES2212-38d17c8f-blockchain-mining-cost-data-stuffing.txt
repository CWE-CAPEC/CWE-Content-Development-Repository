NAME: Insufficient Deterrents in Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms Leading to Potential Blockchain Bloat

DESCRIPTION:

In blockchain systems utilizing Proof of Work (PoW) and other consensus
mechanisms, the economic and technical design determines the cost of mining or
validating a block. This cost is critical in preventing malicious actors from
exploiting the blockchain by inserting large volumes of unnecessary data that
are expensive to store and validate. A critical weakness arises when this cost
is insufficiently high, allowing attackers to perform "data stuffing" attacks.
These attacks involve flooding the blockchain with large amounts of data,
leading to blockchain bloat. This bloat not only increases the storage and
processing burden on nodes but can also degrade network performance and
accessibility, posing a long-term risk of denial of service (DoS).

The vulnerability is rooted in the design of the blockchain's consensus
mechanism, particularly in how it sets the difficulty level of the Proof of Work
(PoW) function or equivalent measures in other mechanisms. Ideally, these
mechanisms should impose a cost on mining activities that is prohibitively high
for attackers wishing to perform data stuffing, yet balanced to allow legitimate
network participation. The weakness is exacerbated in blockchains with variable
block sizes—especially those with typically low transaction volumes—where the
capacity for larger blocks can be misused to insert disproportionate amounts of
data.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This applies because this issue only deals with blockchain
when the cost of mining is low, which appears to be a very rare
exception case. Additional information is needed to know how this
weakness applies in other blockchain scenarios, and what the actual
weakness is.  In addition, there are other technologies and algorithms
using "consensus mechanisms" and/or "proof-of-work" that are not
related to blockchain at all.  Further investigation is needed to
decide whether a new blockchain-specific entry is needed, and how to
address the more general problem.  Please acknowledge this point or
let us know if you disagree.

----------
SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The references provided simply point out the Zcash attack
that occurred. No additional information is available on what the
weakness is and how that relates to creating a new entry on this
issue. Please provide more relevant references that explain the
weakness, preferably a white paper, blog post, or other document that
goes beyond the Zcash example.

RESOLVED ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The actual weakness isn't highlighted in the description or references
provided. Yes, the attacker can insert large amounts of data if the cost of
mining is low, but why is the cost of mining low, what is the actual weakness
that attacker takes advantage of isn't called out. Additional information is
needed to better understand the actual weakness.

Response: Submitter proposed a new description which attempts to clarify the
weakness.  Specifically "A critical weakness arises when this cost [of mining or
validating a block] is insufficiently high", although this still does not get at
why the cost of mining is low.


----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The actual weakness isn't highlighted in the description or
references provided. The description and references focus on the Zcash
attack that occurred without details on what was the actual weakness
that led to that attack. Additional information is needed to better
understand the actual weakness.

Response: Submitter proposed a new description, although it is still
too attack-focused.
