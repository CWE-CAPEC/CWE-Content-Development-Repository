NAME: Insufficient Deterrents in Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms Leading to Potential Blockchain Bloat

DESCRIPTION:

In blockchain systems utilizing Proof of Work (PoW) and other consensus
mechanisms, the economic and technical design determines the cost of mining or
validating a block. This cost is critical in preventing malicious actors from
exploiting the blockchain by inserting large volumes of unnecessary data that
are expensive to store and validate. A critical weakness arises when this cost
is insufficiently high, allowing attackers to perform "data stuffing" attacks.
These attacks involve flooding the blockchain with large amounts of data,
leading to blockchain bloat. This bloat not only increases the storage and
processing burden on nodes but can also degrade network performance and
accessibility, posing a long-term risk of denial of service (DoS).

The vulnerability is rooted in the design of the blockchain's consensus
mechanism, particularly in how it sets the difficulty level of the Proof of Work
(PoW) function or equivalent measures in other mechanisms. Ideally, these
mechanisms should impose a cost on mining activities that is prohibitively high
for attackers wishing to perform data stuffing, yet balanced to allow legitimate
network participation. The weakness is exacerbated in blockchains with variable
block sizes—especially those with typically low transaction volumes—where the
capacity for larger blocks can be misused to insert disproportionate amounts of
data.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: This applies because this issue only deals with blockchain
when the cost of mining is low, which appears to be a very rare
exception case. Additional information is needed to know how this
weakness applies in other blockchain scenarios, and what the actual
weakness is.  In addition, there are other technologies and algorithms
using "consensus mechanisms" and/or "proof-of-work" that are not
related to blockchain at all.  Further investigation is needed to
decide whether a new blockchain-specific entry is needed, and how to
address the more general problem.  Please acknowledge this point or
let us know if you disagree.

Response: At first, I thought this submission needed some
refinement. After reviewing the original text, related incidents, and
existing CWE entries, it became clear that the initial framing focused
too narrowly on specific mechanisms and examples, rather than on the
underlying security properties involved, so I did a complete rewrite.

As part of this rewrite, I re-examined the weakness at a higher level
of abstraction to identify the fundamental assumptions that cause the
security failure. In particular, I focused on systems whose security
guarantees depend on emergent properties such as voluntary
participation, competition among independent actors, and the continued
absence of dominant participants, rather than on enforceable system
invariants. The text below reflects that analysis and is intended to
describe a general security design pattern rather than a specific
implementation or attack scenario.

Reliance on the Absence of Dominant Participants for Security

Description

This weakness occurs when a system relies on voluntary competition
among independent participants, and specifically on the continued
absence of any dominant participant, as a core security property, but
does not enforce constraints to ensure that this condition holds.

In such designs, participation is typically self-selected rather than
assigned, and security-relevant actions (such as access to shared
capacity or system state transitions) are permitted based on the
expectation that multiple independent actors will compete on
relatively similar terms. Under these conditions, competitive pressure
is expected to constrain abuse by making monopolization or sustained
dominance impractical.

When participation is low, concentrated, or uneven, or when a single
participant or small set of participants becomes significantly larger
or more capable than others, this assumption can fail. In those cases,
a dominant participant can legitimately monopolize shared capacity or
system operations while remaining fully compliant with system
rules. This can result in denial of service, transaction suppression,
or long-term state growth without any violation of protocol or policy.

The weakness lies in the design assumption that competitive
non-dominance will persist, rather than in attacker manipulation of
system parameters or costs.

Security Impact

Systems affected by this weakness may experience:

- Suppression or delay of other participants’ actions
- Monopolization of shared capacity or system operations
- Long-term or permanent resource burdens imposed on participants
- Degradation of availability or security guarantees during periods of low participation or increased concentration


Why This Is a Security Weakness

This condition constitutes a security weakness because system
guarantees depend on assumptions about participant behavior,
distribution, and relative capability rather than on enforceable
system invariants. When the absence of dominant participants is not
enforced, security properties can degrade silently as real-world
participation patterns change.

Systems that explicitly account for low-participation scenarios or
that enforce bounds independent of participant dominance do not
exhibit this weakness. The existence of such designs demonstrates that
reliance on emergent competitive symmetry represents a correctable
security design flaw, not an unavoidable tradeoff.

Examples

The following documented cases illustrate this weakness in practice:

- Bitcoin transaction spam (“stress testing”, 2015):
  - During periods of relatively low transaction volume, a deliberate
  transaction spam campaign was able to saturate block capacity,
  increasing fees and degrading availability despite all transactions
  paying required fees.
  - Reference:
    - https://damonmccoy.com/papers/bitcoin16-final22.pdf
- Ethereum denial-of-service attacks via underpriced operations (2016):
  - Ethereum developers documented denial-of-service attacks that
  exploited conditions where participation levels and pricing allowed
  a small number of actors to dominate block usage, leading to
  protocol-level repricing changes.

    - https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/22/ethereum-network-currently-undergoing-dos-attack
- Fomo3D block stuffing attack (2018):
  - An attacker successfully filled blocks with valid, high-cost
  transactions to prevent other participants’ transactions from being
  included, exploiting the absence of sufficient competing activity to
  suppress others and claim the prize.
  - References:

    - https://medium.com/@zhongqiangc/smart-contract-stuffing-fomo3d-42cb1d11ab03

These examples demonstrate that systems whose security depends on the
continued absence of dominant participants can fail when real-world
participation patterns change, even when all actions comply with
system rules.

Relationship to Existing CWE Entries

After reviewing the existing CWE taxonomy, this weakness does not map
cleanly to a current CWE entry. It represents a system-level design
assumption about participation, competition, and dominance, rather
than a failure of a specific control.

The following CWEs are conceptually related, although the relationship is not strong and is noted for context:

- CWE-285: Improper Authorization
  - Loosely related in that security-relevant actions are effectively
    permitted based on insufficient criteria. In this case, the
    absence of dominant participants implicitly acts as a gating
    condition, but this is not a traditional authorization failure.
- CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
  - Analogous in failure mode only. CWE-328 describes cryptographic
    primitives whose effective brute-force resistance is too
    low. The present weakness describes system designs whose
    effective deterrence collapses when assumptions about
    participant dominance are violated. Both involve security
    assumptions failing when real-world conditions differ from
    expectations, but at different abstraction levels.
    
This submission is therefore proposed as a standalone CWE, capturing a
design weakness not currently represented elsewhere in the taxonomy.

Notes on Scope

This weakness is not limited to blockchain systems. Blockchain
examples are included only because they provide well-documented,
observable instances of the pattern. The weakness applies to any
system where security depends on voluntary participation and the
continued absence of dominant participants, rather than on enforceable
limits or invariants.

Closing note

At this point, the submission reflects a clearer understanding of the
underlying security properties involved and separates the weakness
itself from any particular mechanism or implementation. If there are
additional adjustments that would help align this further with CWE
expectations, I’m happy to refine it further.


----------
SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The references provided simply point out the Zcash attack
that occurred. No additional information is available on what the
weakness is and how that relates to creating a new entry on this
issue. Please provide more relevant references that explain the
weakness, preferably a white paper, blog post, or other document that
goes beyond the Zcash example.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY; SUBMITTER PROVIDED REFERENCES IN

RESOLVED ISSUES:


SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The actual weakness isn't highlighted in the description or references
provided. Yes, the attacker can insert large amounts of data if the cost of
mining is low, but why is the cost of mining low, what is the actual weakness
that attacker takes advantage of isn't called out. Additional information is
needed to better understand the actual weakness.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Submitter proposed a new
description which attempts to clarify the weakness.  Specifically "A
critical weakness arises when this cost [of mining or validating a
block] is insufficiently high", although this still does not get at
why the cost of mining is low.


----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The actual weakness isn't highlighted in the description or
references provided. The description and references focus on the Zcash
attack that occurred without details on what was the actual weakness
that led to that attack. Additional information is needed to better
understand the actual weakness.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Submitter proposed a new
description, although it is still too attack-focused.
