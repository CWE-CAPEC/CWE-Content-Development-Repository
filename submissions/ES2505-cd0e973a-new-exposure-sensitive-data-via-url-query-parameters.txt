ACTIVE ISSUES:



SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission seems to heavily overlap with CWE-598.  CWE-598 focuses
on GET requests using sensitive query strings, with the assumption that 
POST requests should be using the request body for their info.  It is possible
that CWE-598 could be adjusted to include all HTTP requests, for all
methods, in which sensitive query strings are included, and that would encompass the submission.
CWE-598 is very old and could benefit from more modern recommendations.  Please let us know your thoughts
about the overlap with CWE-598.

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: While the reference provided shows an example of this weakness happening
in the wild, it does not discuss the actual weakness and provide additional context
that explains why putting sensitive information in a URL query parameter is bad (even 
if it is obvious to some readers).  Please include a different reference that supports
the stated weakness and explains why putting sensitive information in query parameters 
is bad, and potentially also describes things such as best practices and mitigations.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: If we all agree that this submission does in fact work better as
a modification to CWE-598 to include all HTTP requests, then this submission 
will need to change to a modification.  However, there is a possibility that the CWE
team might decide to create a more general entry. This will be addressed in a
later phase. Please acknowledge that you have seen this comment.

----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: It appears from the stated reference that this submission could potentially
be related to a vulnerability report for a specific vulnerability in a specific product.
CWE does not focus on specific products, although the name and description of your 
submission are in line with typical CWE content. If you wanted to obtain a CVE ID for 
the vulnerability, please visit https://cveform.mitre.org/.  If your intention was to 
submit content directly to CWE, then please indicate if you were intending a new
CWE entry or proposing any changes to existing entries.
