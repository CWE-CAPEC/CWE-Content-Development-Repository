RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: After we went through a review, we think that if the image
illustrates someone walking through an open door (say a safe door) and
the safe door has a sign on it that reads, “critical function” that it
would complement the description of the weakness much better. Would it
be possible for you to create such an image?
