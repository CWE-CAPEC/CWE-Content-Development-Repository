NAME: Weak Authorization Mechanism

DESCRIPTION:

1.  An EV charging app developed by TCS, was implemented with a login page
for their android application.

2. The login page consisted of sign-in, sign-up and forget password
features.

3. The account creation was based on phone number, which was flawed as any
random 10 digits number would be accepted.

4. The main flawed part was of their authorization, to create account and
to login, the application would send OTP on the registered phone number.
But, the way it was implemented was very insecure as they were displaying
the OTP sent to registered number in the response.

5. Meaning an attack agent can not only create bot accounts as OTPs where
getting reflected in the response, but also could reset password for legit
user and block them out of their account as they wouldn't get notified that
their password has been changed.
