PUBTRACKER: #107

GITHUBUSER: kushhh01

SUBMISSION TYPE: Software

NAME: Weak Authorization Mechanism

DESCRIPTION:

1.  An EV charging app developed by TCS, was implemented with a login page
for their android application.

2. The login page consisted of sign-in, sign-up and forget password
features.

3. The account creation was based on phone number, which was flawed as any
random 10 digits number would be accepted.

4. The main flawed part was of their authorization, to create account and
to login, the application would send OTP on the registered phone number.
But, the way it was implemented was very insecure as they were displaying
the OTP sent to registered number in the response.

5. Meaning an attack agent can not only create bot accounts as OTPs where
getting reflected in the response, but also could reset password for legit
user and block them out of their account as they wouldn't get notified that
their password has been changed.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: An initial submission (or full submission) cannot progress past
the consultation phase until SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The submitter highlights the proposed entry as an IDOR type issue in
the description. However, the provided reference indicates that the issue
additionally involves lack of proper phone number validation, clear text
transmission of credentials, and absence of rate limit, among others. This
complex mix of information makes it challenging to comprehend the weakness from
the submission. The aforementioned CWEs were derived from the attack description
and reference provided. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this
comment.

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The submission identifies pre-existing CWEs, including
CWE-639 and CWE-201, along with mentions of CWE-20, CWE-319, among
others. Although there is overlap with existing CWEs, there may be a
possibility to include examples from this submission in existing
CWEs. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK - "Multiple weaknesses"

Description: The submission describes or suggests multiple independent
weaknesses that each might deserve a separate CWE ID.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
until the number of relevant weaknesses is identified. If there are
multiple weaknesses, separate names and descriptions are needed.

Comments: The proposed entry emphasizes aspects such as authorization, IDOR,
lack of phone number validation, clear text transmission of credentials, and the
absence of a rate limit, among others. While this submission is not suited for a
new entry given this, it may be suited to add an example to several existing
CWEs. Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ATTACK - "Too attack-focused"

Description: The submission's name and/or description emphasizes the
attack, not the weakness. Either the submission's weakness is not
well-understood, or it is better described as an attack pattern, which may
be suitable for inclusion in CAPEC.

Resolution: An initial submission cannot progress to later phases unless it
also includes a clear weakness (i.e., is not subject to SUB.UNCLEAR).

Comments: The proposed submission is essentially describing an attack. Note that
it's not even a general attack but a very specific attack on a specific product.
This may indiciate that the submission is better suited as an example to be
added to a CWE(s). Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------


SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to Stage 3 (Content-Generation)
until the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Because the submission describes several attacks that are
related to multiple existing CWEs, the CWE Team believes that this submission is best
suited as a modification to one or more existing CWE entries.  The
modification could be an added demonstrative or observed example to
possibly CWE-639 (for IDOR) and CWE-201 (for leaking the OTP in a
response). The researcher advisory also mentions other
vulnerabilities, but they might not be included in the CWE
modifications (e.g., CWE-20 ("no proper validation of phone number"),
CWE-319 ("clear text transmission of credentials"), CWE-799 ("no rate
limit")).  Please indicate if you agree with this evaluation.
