NAME: Logic Transformation Discrepancy during RTL Synthesis

DESCRIPTION:

This weakness occurs when a hardware design exhibits unintended behavior at
the gate-level netlist that is not present at the RTL level. Such
divergence arises due to synthesis-related artifacts - for example,
missing signals in sensitivity lists, undefined or partially specified
logic, a malicious user exploiting/injectung bugs through EDA Synthesis
Tools or synthesis optimizations that alter control or data paths. These
discrepancies lead to functional mismatches that are difficult to detect
during RTL simulation but manifest post-synthesis, potentially causing 
functional failures in the final chip.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.COORD - "Requires extensive coordination"

Description: The submission will require or is currently undergoing close
coordination, discussion, and debate between multiple parties with
different perspectives and opinions.  The communication could be taking
place in CDR itself, or outside of CDR.  As a result, it might take longer
to move the submission to later phases, although the submission is expected
to be more robust and well-defined as a result of this coordination.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient consensus has been reached, or if
the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.

Comments: There has been strong interest from multiple parties
involving security concerns related to RTL, but there are indications
that there may be multiple weaknesses (see SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK), and the
issues are not necessarily clearly described as weaknesses (see
SUB.UNCLEAR).  In December 2025, the CWE Team formed an Ad-Hoc RTL
Working Group to focus technical discussion around weaknesses related
to RTL.  This group's work will include and influence the contents of
this submission, but it might take time to reach the appropriate
conclusions.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY; SUBMITTER IS AWARE OF THE WORKING
GROUP.]

----------

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: While the description highlights "unintended
behavior... that is not present at the RTL level," it does not
sufficiently explain what errors (weaknesses) caused this behavior, or
what the security implications are.  There are indications of multiple
errors, such as "missing signals in sensitivity lists" and
"optimizations that alter control or data paths." However, there needs
to be deeper analysis to more clearly indicate the specific weakness
(or weaknesses) that are involved. It is important to note that there
is other CWE coverage for "disrepancies" or "mismatches" such as
CWE-1068: Inconsistency Between Implementation and Documented Design,
and CWE-733: Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of
Security-critical Code. For issues related to state, there might be
options such as CWE-1250: Improper Preservation of Consistency Between
Independent Representations of Shared State. Finally, section 6 of the
cited paper for CLiMA (Compromised Library Mapping Attack) may map to
CWE-1357: Reliance on Insufficiently Trustworthy Component: "during
the synthesis process, library binaries provided by fabrication
vendors are fed to the EDA synthesis SynFuzz: Leveraging Fuzzing of
Netlist to Detect Synthesis Bugs tool to map the design to library
gate cells. However, an adversary or a malicious library vendor can
exploit the optimizations of the EDA tool to manipulate the mapping
process and create a malicious version of the hardware."

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY; WORK TO CONTINUE WITHIN THE WORKING GROUP].

----------

SUB.ABS.MULTWEAK - "Multiple weaknesses"

Description: The submission describes or suggests multiple independent
weaknesses that each might deserve a separate CWE ID.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
until the number of relevant weaknesses is identified. If there are
multiple weaknesses, separate names and descriptions are needed.

Comments: As described in SUB.UNCLEAR, there are indications that
there may be multiple weaknesses involved that can cause unintended
behavior. These will be determined as a result of active discussion
within the RTL Working Group.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NECESSARY; WORK TO CONTINUE WITHIN THE WORKING GROUP].
