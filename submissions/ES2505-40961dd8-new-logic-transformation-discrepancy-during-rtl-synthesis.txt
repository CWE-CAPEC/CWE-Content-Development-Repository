NAME: Logic Transformation Discrepancy during RTL Synthesis

DESCRIPTION:

This weakness occurs when a hardware design exhibits unintended behavior at
the gate-level netlist that is not present at the RTL level. Such
divergence arises due to synthesis-related artifacts u2014 for example,
missing signals in sensitivity lists, undefined or partially specified
logic, a malicious user exploiting/injectung bugs through EDA Synthesis
Tools or synthesis optimizations that alter control or data paths. These
discrepancies lead to functional mismatches that are difficult to detect
during RTL simulation but manifest post-synthesis, potentially causing 
functional failures in the final chip.
