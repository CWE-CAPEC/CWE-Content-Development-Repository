NAME: CWE-300 mod - add DAST detection method

DESCRIPTION:

Suggest to add DAST detection method.

The CWE-300 current Detection Methods with only "Automated Static Analysis"
with detection "High" is likely inaccurate and its generic description not
supporting actual detection implementation.

From a server channel perspective:
- Encryption is usually done by an upfront network appliance
(load-balancer/firewall) to handle TLS termination and lake of which cannot
be detected by SAST.
- Lack of authentication/authorization is usually not detected by SAST
tools due to the variety of frameworks.
For example, related weaknesses (eg CWE-862/863) includes DAST to detect
missing encryption/verification. Although fault positive might be found on
intended public endpoints, many tools enable schema based (eg OpenAPI
swagger) definition of which endpoints are intended secure.

From a Client channel perspective, while many elements are in the control
scope of the remote target which cannot be confirmed in the client
application the channel verification is often in the scope of CWE-287 for
TLS based communication. Therefore, it might be relevant to add reference
to that weakness.
