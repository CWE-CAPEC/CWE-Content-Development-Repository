NAME: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS with email and other content

DESCRIPTION:

While HTTPS forcing works correct, everything looks fine, but when failed
that could be an issue when sender will use as a link HTTP instead of HTTPS.
Example: https://www.example.com marked as safe, when
http://www.example.com is marked as unsafe by browsers. When sender gives a
link like this form: 'example.com' will take a user to unsafe site like
http://example.com/ Actually it doesn't have to be with sensitive data, in
some cases some 'connection/traffic' user-site can be sufficient for bad
actor. Proposed remediation: use https:// for provided site's links (skip
the use forms like "example.com" or "http://example.com").
