NAME: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS with email and other content

DESCRIPTION:

While HTTPS forcing works correct, everything looks fine, but when failed
that could be an issue when sender will use as a link HTTP instead of HTTPS.
Example: https://www.example.com marked as safe, when
http://www.example.com is marked as unsafe by browsers. When sender gives a
link like this form: 'example.com' will take a user to unsafe site like
http://example.com/ Actually it doesn't have to be with sensitive data, in
some cases some 'connection/traffic' user-site can be sufficient for bad
actor. Proposed remediation: use https:// for provided site's links (skip
the use forms like "example.com" or "http://example.com").

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: The CWE Team believes that ES2302-c4107569 "Lack of HTTPS
forcing" and ES2302-1f7d9e54 "Using HTTP instead of HTTPS with email
and other content" are both too low-level to receive their own new CWE
IDs. However, we plan to create a new CWE entry, at the Variant level
of abstraction, which covers "Use of HTTP instead of HTTPS". We will
then integrate both submissions into that new entry, and we will
ensure that your submission is appropriately credited. This submission
might be integrated as part of an extended description, technical
details, and/or a demonstrative example. Please let us know if you
agree with this approach.

Response: Sounds great, thank you. Agree.

----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that must be fixed before the Publication stage.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
move to the Publication stage without grammar and spelling checks. American
English is used for spelling.

Comments: The grammar issues are not significant enough to prevent
movement to the next phase. Once this submission is integrated into
the new entry, the CWE Team will suggest alternate phrasing for this
description. The phrasing may need to be changed depending on which
element this submission is integrated into (extended description,
demonstrative example, or other).  Please let us know if you agree.

Response: Agree. Thank you again.
