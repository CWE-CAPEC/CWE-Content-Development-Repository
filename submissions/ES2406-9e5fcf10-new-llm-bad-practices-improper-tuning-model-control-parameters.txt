NAME: Insecure Setting of Generative AI/ML Model Inference Parameters

DESCRIPTION:

Single-sentence summary - The product has a component that relies on a
generative AI/ML model, but the model is configured with incorrect
inference parameters that produce excessive erroneous or unexpected
outputs that violate the intended security policy.

Extended description - Generative AI/ML models, such as those used for
text generation, image synthesis, and other creative tasks, rely on
inference parameters that control model behavior, such as temperature,
Top P, and Top K. These parameters affect the model's internal
decision-making processes, learning rate, and probability
distributions. Incorrect settings can lead to unusual behavior such as
"hallucinations" in text generation, unrealistic images, or failure to
converge during training. The impact of such misconfigurations can
compromise the integrity of the application. If the results are used
in security-critical operations or decisions, then this could violate
the intended security policy, i.e., introduce a vulnerability.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: The name and description were discussed and refined in
multiple meetings. They are nearly complete, pending further
discussion. The name/description were updated based on WG discussion
in CDR and the 2025-02-28 AI WG meeting. They are now sufficiently
clear to allow moving the submission to Stage 2.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; DETAILED DISCUSSION IS ONGOING.]

----------

SUB.COORD - "Requires extensive coordination"

Description: The submission will require or is currently undergoing close
coordination, discussion, and debate between multiple parties with
different perspectives and opinions.  The communication could be taking
place in CDR itself, or outside of CDR.  As a result, it might take longer
to move the submission to later phases, although the submission is expected
to be more robust and well-defined as a result of this coordination.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient consensus has been reached, or if
the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.

Comments: This submission is undergoing active review and development
within the CWE AI Working Group.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; DETAILED DISCUSSION IS ONGOING.]



RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.NEWTECH - "New/Emerging Technology"

Description: The submission is related to a new or emerging technology that
is not well-understood from a weakness perspective, which can cause real or
perceived gaps in CWE that require extra effort and time to analyze.
Typically, for new/emerging technologies, early vulnerability discovery and
research does not focus on root cause analysis (i.e., weakness
identification). Instead, the focus is on other areas such as attacks and
exploitation methods, technical impacts, threats, mitigations, or other
concerns.  As a result, industry understanding can be limited, effectively
requiring research or focused efforts by SMEs to understand the underlying
weaknesses.  Rapidly-changing, diverse terminology and technology can
further complicate understanding. Finally, there might not be enough
real-world examples with sufficient details from which weakness patterns
may be discovered.  For this reason, it can be difficult to determine
whether CWE entries already cover the topics of concern, and which gaps (if
any) exist.  As of May 2024, some new or emerging technologies include
AI/ML, cryptocurrency/blockchain, post-quantum cryptography, and
large-scale architectures with many components that have different trust
boundaries.  In previous years, new/emerging domains for CWE included
hardware, cloud, and ICS/OT.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient attempts have been made to
understand the weaknesses commonly seen in new or emerging technologies, or
if the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.  Analysis
could include analyzing well-known attacks to understand the weaknesses
that enable the attacks to succeed; analysis of mitigations to understand
how the underlying weaknesses are perceived; and/or other methods.  Such
analysis might require consultation with a variety of Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs).

Comments: Since AI/ML weakness classification is new, it might require
some effort to determine the best way to clarify this
weakness. However, as of February 14, 2025, discussion by CWE AI WG
members does not suggest that there are substantive problems with
characterizing a weakness in terms of parameters to AI/ML
products.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; ISSUE RESOLVED.]

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: In the 2025-02-28 AI WG meeting, the submission was
generalized to include multiple kinds of generative AI, not just
Transformers and text generation. Lower-level children could be
created in the future if necessary.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; ISSUE RESOLVED.]

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: It is not clear what CWEs would be related to this weakness,
although this problem does not need to be fully resolved in this
stage. Relationships might depend on the kinds of behaviors that are
affected by the chosen parameters. Within CWE, "poor configuration" is
not itself a weakness - it is more like a phase or activity in the
development lifecycle that controls or affects the behavior of a
product. Since CWE weaknesses are focused on behavior, it will be
important to understand the behavior-related implications of model
parameters in order to determine the relationships.  Somewhat related
weaknesses include CWE-440: Expected Behavior Violation (which is
defined relative to a specification) or its parent CWE-684: Incorrect
Provision of Specified Functionality. Alternately there is CWE-696:
Incorrect Behavior Order as a child of CWE-691: Insufficient Control
Flow Management.  Please acknowledge that you have seen this comment;
no additional discussion is necessary at this time.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; ISSUE RESOLVED.] During the February 28
WG meeting, these relationships were discussed, and there was general
agreement that it made sense to capture relationships with CWE-440 and
CWE-665 (Improper Initialization).
