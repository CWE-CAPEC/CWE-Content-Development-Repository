NAME: LLM Bad Practices: Improper tuning of model control parameters

DESCRIPTION:

Users of applications that use Transformers text generation capabilities
may encounter unusually high occurrences of repetition/hallucination due to
combinations of parameter settings that control model probabilities and
behavior. For example, high temperatures increase randomness in generated
text and various repetition penalties can reduce the amount of output
repetition.

Note: this submission is inspired by "CWE-382: J2EE Bad Practices: Use of
System.exit()", the idea of approaching LLM-related weaknesses via their
software practices

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the Publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: It is not clear what CWEs would be related to this weakness,
although this problem does not need to be fully resolved in this
stage. Relationships might depend on the kinds of behaviors that are
affected by the chosen parameters. Within CWE, "poor configuration" is
not itself a weakness - it is more like a phase or activity in the
development lifecycle that controls or affects the behavior of a
product. Since CWE weaknesses are focused on behavior, it will be
important to understand the behavior-related implications of model
parameters in order to determine the relationships.  Somewhat related
weaknesses include CWE-440: Expected Behavior Violation (which is
defined relative to a specification) or its parent CWE-684: Incorrect
Provision of Specified Functionality. Alternately there is CWE-696:
Incorrect Behavior Order as a child of CWE-691: Insufficient Control
Flow Management.  Please acknowledge that you have seen this comment;
no additional discussion is necessary at this time.

----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: In a 2025-02-14 AI WG meeting, the question was raised that
the focus on Transformers and/or text generation was likely too
low-level. However, there appeared to be general agreement that this
submission could be generalized more. Ongoing discussion will help
resolve this issue.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; DETAILED DISCUSSION IS ONGOING.]

----------

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: While the general idea makes sense, the description (and
perhaps the name) could be improved before moving to Stage 2 (Detailed
Submission). Discussion by the AI WG has already begun as of a
2025-02-14 meeting; once some consensus is reached within AI WG
members, this submission's description and/or name will be changed.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; DETAILED DISCUSSION IS ONGOING.]

----------

SUB.COORD - "Requires extensive coordination"

Description: The submission will require or is currently undergoing close
coordination, discussion, and debate between multiple parties with
different perspectives and opinions.  The communication could be taking
place in CDR itself, or outside of CDR.  As a result, it might take longer
to move the submission to later phases, although the submission is expected
to be more robust and well-defined as a result of this coordination.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient consensus has been reached, or if
the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.

Comments: This submission is undergoing active review and development
within the CWE AI Working Group.

Response: [NO RESPONSE NEEDED; DETAILED DISCUSSION IS ONGOING.]



RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.NEWTECH - "New/Emerging Technology"

Description: The submission is related to a new or emerging technology that
is not well-understood from a weakness perspective, which can cause real or
perceived gaps in CWE that require extra effort and time to analyze.
Typically, for new/emerging technologies, early vulnerability discovery and
research does not focus on root cause analysis (i.e., weakness
identification). Instead, the focus is on other areas such as attacks and
exploitation methods, technical impacts, threats, mitigations, or other
concerns.  As a result, industry understanding can be limited, effectively
requiring research or focused efforts by SMEs to understand the underlying
weaknesses.  Rapidly-changing, diverse terminology and technology can
further complicate understanding. Finally, there might not be enough
real-world examples with sufficient details from which weakness patterns
may be discovered.  For this reason, it can be difficult to determine
whether CWE entries already cover the topics of concern, and which gaps (if
any) exist.  As of May 2024, some new or emerging technologies include
AI/ML, cryptocurrency/blockchain, post-quantum cryptography, and
large-scale architectures with many components that have different trust
boundaries.  In previous years, new/emerging domains for CWE included
hardware, cloud, and ICS/OT.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the Init-Consultation or
Det-Consultation phases until sufficient attempts have been made to
understand the weaknesses commonly seen in new or emerging technologies, or
if the CWE Team decides to move the submission to the next phase.  Analysis
could include analyzing well-known attacks to understand the weaknesses
that enable the attacks to succeed; analysis of mitigations to understand
how the underlying weaknesses are perceived; and/or other methods.  Such
analysis might require consultation with a variety of Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs).

Comments: Since AI/ML weakness classification is new, it might require
some effort to determine the best way to clarify this
weakness. However, as of February 14, 2025, discussion by CWE AI WG
members does not suggest that there are substantive problems with
characterizing a weakness in terms of parameters to AI/ML
products.
