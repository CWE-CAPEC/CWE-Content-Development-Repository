NAME: Inclusion of ANSI escape codes in LLM tokenizer

DESCRIPTION:

Desc: ANSI escape codes are included in a tokenizer. This can result in the
execution of commands if LLM generated text is displayed in a terminal
emulator.

Extended Description: ANSI escape sequences are a standard for controlling
options in text terminals and terminal emulators that embed an escape
character into text, which are interpreted as commands instead of text to
be displayed. This can result in unexpected command injection (CWE-77).

This impacts tokenizers used with large language models. Since large
language models are generally expected to output human-readable text,
tokenizers should not contain these escape sequences.

RELATED WEAKNESSES:

   ChildOf CWE-77
   ChildOf CWE-1426
