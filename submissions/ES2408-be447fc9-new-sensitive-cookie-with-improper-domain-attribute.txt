NAME: Sensitive Cookie with Improper Domain Attribute

DESCRIPTION:

The Domain attribute for a sensitive cookies is set with an overly
permissive value causing it to be sent to unintended hosts.

The Domain attribute controls to which FQDN a cookie is sent with requests
to. When the Domain attribute is not set, it will only be sent with
requests to the FQDN the cookie was set by, which is the most secure
configuration. When the Domain attribute is set, it will be sent with
requests to the FQDN and its immediate subdomains. 

This is often done either by mistake, when without the Domain attribute
would have sufficed, or on purpose for convenience so that the cookie will
be sent with requests for some intended sibling subdomains, but
intentionally also causes the cookie to be sent to FQDNs that do not use
the cookie.

In the case of a sensitive cookie, such as a cookie used for
authentication, or otherwise storing sensitive data, this causes
inadvertent improper transmission of sensitive data including making
possible session hijacking/theft attacks.
