NAME: Sensitive Exif metadata not stripped out during upload by user when redundant

DESCRIPTION:

In cases when product or service don't need an informations like GPS data
it is redundant from point of view of product and service, but at the same
time it is a threat for users. It can leads to expose of sensitive data
like home address and similar. Example: typical chat or forum where users
can upload their photos as avatars - bad actor can check in manual or
automatic way photos' Exif data and get to know about geolocalization data.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

RESOLVED ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: Since EXIF data is effectively metadata, it might seem that
CWE-1230: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata would
apply - however, CWE-1230's focus is more on databases and other
resources where the metadata/search-indices are external to the
resource in question. CWE-1230 might need to be changed. More
appropriate would be CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive
Information Before Storage or Transfer. However, CWE-359 also applies,
but the overlap between CWE-212 and CWE-359 requires larger research
efforts to resolve.  We plan to update CWE-212 and CWE-359 to include
EXIF as a consideration. Please let us know if you agree.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Sounds great. I agree with you.


----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or full) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: The relationship between CWE-212 and CWE-359 requires larger
research efforts to resolve, but it can be resolved
independently. This is simply to notify you of the additional work
that is needed by the CWE Team. Please acknowledge that you've seen
this item.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] I agree with you.


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: It is not appropriate to create CWEs unique to EXIF data (or
any particular kind of technology-specific data at such a low level),
since these are probably even lower-level than Variants. We plan to
perform a Modification of the existing CWE-212 and CWE-359 instead of
creating a new entry. Please acknowledge this point or let us know if
you disagree.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] I agree with you.

----------

SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: This is being treated as a Modification - not a New Entry.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] I agree with you.


SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: The submitter posted additional references to CDR on
December 4.  This issue no longer applies.
