NAME: Use of a Quantum-Vulnerable Cryptographic Algorithm

DESCRIPTION:

Cryptographic algorithms are used to protect the confidentiality and
authenticity stored in or transmitted through an untrusted medium. 
Quantum-vulnerable algorithms will be exploitable if or when a
Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is built, in which case
sensitive information could be exposed, data could be undetectably
modified, and the identities of users and devices could be spoofed, among
other impacts.	

Data that is encrypted by a quantum-vulnerable encryption or key
establishment algorithm, and has a long data protection period, is
especially at risk, because an adversary can store encrypted data today and
decrypt it later with a CRQC . Such an attack is called
harvest-now-decrypt-later, and it creates significant risk for long-term
data confidentiality.  Additionally, an adversary with a CRQC could forge
signatures for quantum-vulnerable algorithms, creating a risk for
signatures with a long data protection period, especially those used to
sign software ima
