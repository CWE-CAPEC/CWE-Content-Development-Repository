NAME: Silent Email Alias Normalization Leading to Misdelivery and Account Takeover

DESCRIPTION:

This weakness involves products (e.g., web applications) silently
modifying user-supplied email addresses by removing aliasing syntax
(such as stripping the +tag from user+tag@example.com) without user
notification or confirmation. Such behavior results in an altered
email (usertag@example.com), which may belong to a different,
unintended recipient.

When email address changes or password resets occur, notifications are
then sent to this unintended address. This can lead to: Information
Disclosure, when confidential data is sent to a third party; Account
Takeover (ATO), if the derived address is registered or controlled by
a malicious actor; Authentication Integrity Failures, where user
identity is silently altered mid-process.

The core issue is the lack of transparency and validation in how the
product handles user identity data, especially in authentication and
notification contexts. This is a security-impacting behavior, not a
feature. While it may stem from alias-stripping logic intended for
normalization or anti-abuse purposes, the absence of user visibility
and control turns it into a critical flaw.

This class of weaknesses can be generalized under input
validation/sanitization, identifier integrity, or misconfigured
notification systems, but may warrant explicit representation or
dedicated examples in existing CWE entries.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The provided description doesn't highlight an exact weakness.
Is the weakness that some sites don't allow the use of email aliases? Or is 
the removal of "+" sign an issue? What if this is a feature of the site vs. a bug?
The submitter should provide more context about the weakness and 
how that is a security concern that should be captured in the CWE?

Response: Thank you for the feedback. To clarify: the weakness lies in
a product silently altering user-submitted email addresses by
stripping aliases (e.g., user+alias@example.com becomes
useralias@example.com) without user notification or confirmation. This
behavior, when paired with insufficient notification mechanisms, can
lead to security issues including information disclosure and account
takeover (ATO). The issue is not that email aliases are disallowed,
but that the product deceptively changes the address post-submission,
breaking user expectations and creating a dangerous mismatch between
user intent and system behavior. This is a bug with clear security
impact, as misdirected notifications or password reset emails may end
up in unintended mailboxes, especially if the derived email address is
valid and controlled by an attacker.


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: The issue around the improper notification of e-mail aliases
is very niche to warrant its own CWE. As that is largely dictated by
the use of the website and their policies, it can't be generalized in
a CWE.  This example could possibly be used in another CWE, such as
CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value or CWE-222: Truncation of
Security-relevant Information. The CWE Team will investigate this in
later phases.

Response:While this issue may seem niche, its underlying weakness is
generalizable: it represents a failure in input sanitization
transparency, and poor validation of user identifiers. The product
modifies a user-supplied email without proper validation or user
feedback. This class of issues fits within broader CWE themes such as
CWE-182 (Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value), but introduces a
real-world exploit scenario not well covered by existing
CWEs. Therefore, it could either be addressed via an extension of an
existing CWE or through improved examples under entries like CWE-222
(Truncation of Security-Relevant Information) or CWE-345 (Insufficient
Verification of Data Authenticity). This behavior is not tied to a
specific framework but represents a design-level weakness with
security consequences. The logic is flawed, regardless of the
technology stack.


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The submission only provides a Wikipedia reference, which by itself
isn't a credible reference. Please provide other real-world references of this
issue.

Response: At the time of submission, the issue had been observed
firsthand in real-world products, including in responsible disclosure
reports. While public references may be scarce due to the sensitive
nature of such findings (often under private VDP or bug bounty
programs), I can provide more anonymized examples or documented
reports if needed. Additionally, this pattern of behavior is
observable in several modern applications that attempt to normalize
email addresses but fail to inform users. Given that this is a subtle
but dangerous behavior, it is underreported in public documentation,
but exploitation is feasible and impactful.

CWE-319 / CWE-201 (Information Exposure)

CWE-640 (Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password)

CWE-345 / CWE-346 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity / Source)

----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission is similar to the one proposed in
ES2503-a0f69c3b (CDR #150).  Therefore, the CWE team will treat both
submissions at the same time, possibly combining them if
appropriate. Note that both submitters would receive credit.

Response: I understand the similarity with ES2503-a0f69c3b. If the
weaknesses are closely related, I support combining them, provided
that the scenario involving silent modification of aliases leading to
notification redirection and ATO risks is preserved as an example or
subclass. I'm fully open to collaborative refinement if that helps
clarify and generalize the core weakness. As long as the security
impact and exploit path are accurately conveyed, I'm satisfied with
the merged representation.

PS. This submission was sent on 2023.

----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: Given that the submission's weakness isn't clear and the specificity
of a niche products/technology, it is difficult to determine which action 
(e.g., create a new entry or update an existing entry) is needed.

Response: Given the nature of the weakness and its potential security
impact, I believe the most appropriate action would be to either (1)
create a new CWE that addresses silent input transformation leading to
authentication/notification mismatches or (2) extend an existing CWE
such as CWE-345 or CWE-222 to include this scenario. I’m also open to
this being used as a high-impact example under CWE-319 (Information
Exposure via altered notification address). My primary goal is to
ensure this class of bug — where a product silently transforms user
identity data leading to ATO or disclosure — is captured, even if not
as a standalone CWE.
