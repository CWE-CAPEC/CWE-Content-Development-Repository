NAME: Improper site protection against using email aliases can provide to ATO and account issues

DESCRIPTION:

Some site focused on bug hunting security don't allowed using email aliases
- but that was quite dangerous case, because when user wanted to change an
email to email with alias (example+alias@example.com) the result without
any notification was: examplealias@example.com (removed + sign) Example:
bughunter@example.com vs bughunter1@example.com instead of
bughunter+1@example.com When site has proper email notifications, the email
will be send on incorrect address (about Email changed) and in many cases
bad actor can make ATO (using Reset password feature).
