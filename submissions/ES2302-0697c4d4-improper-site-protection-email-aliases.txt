NAME: Improper site protection against using email aliases can provide to ATO and account issues

DESCRIPTION:

Some site focused on bug hunting security don't allowed using email aliases
- but that was quite dangerous case, because when user wanted to change an
email to email with alias (example+alias@example.com) the result without
any notification was: examplealias@example.com (removed + sign) Example:
bughunter@example.com vs bughunter1@example.com instead of
bughunter+1@example.com When site has proper email notifications, the email
will be send on incorrect address (about Email changed) and in many cases
bad actor can make ATO (using Reset password feature).

Can leads also to Information Disclosure. (saw today another example on prod.)

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.UNCLEAR - "Unclear weakness"

Description: The submission's name and/or description does not clearly
identify a weakness, or it is written in a way that is vague and could
cause the submission to be incorrectly mapped to.

Resolution: A submission cannot progress past the consultation phase until
SUB.UNCLEAR is addressed.

Comments: The provided description doesn't highlight an exact weakness.
Is the weakness that some sites don't allow the use of email aliases? Or is 
the removal of "+" sign an issue? What if this is a feature of the site vs. a bug?
The submitter should provide more context about the weakness and 
how that is a security concern that should be captured in the CWE?

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: The issue around the improper notification of e-mail aliases
is very niche to warrant its own CWE. As that is largely dictated by
the use of the website and their policies, it can't be generalized in
a CWE.  This example could possibly be used in another CWE, such as
CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value or CWE-222: Truncation of
Security-relevant Information. The CWE Team will investigate this in
later phases.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The submission only provides a Wikipedia reference, which by itself
isn't a credible reference. Please provide other real-world references of this
issue.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses or other submissions,
indicating problems with the submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: This submission is similar to the one proposed in
ES2503-a0f69c3b (CDR #150).  Therefore, the CWE team will treat both
submissions at the same time, possibly combining them if
appropriate. Note that both submitters would receive credit.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: Given that the submission's weakness isn't clear and the specificity
of a niche products/technology, it is difficult to determine which action 
(e.g., create a new entry or update an existing entry) is needed.
