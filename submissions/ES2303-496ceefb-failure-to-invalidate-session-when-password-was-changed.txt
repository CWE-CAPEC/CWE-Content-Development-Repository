NAME: Failure to Invalidate Session when password was changed

DESCRIPTION:

After changing a password, the active session should be
invalidated. For instance, if a victim's credentials are leaked and a
malicious actor is using them, the victim may change their password
for increased protection. However, if the session is not invalidated
when the password is changed, the malicious actor can still exploit
the account because the victim is not automatically logged out.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: The suggested entry bears a striking resemblance to the
existing CWE-613 and CWE-384. However, a key distinction lies in the
fact that CWE-613 pertains to reuse of old sessions due to timeouts,
while CWE-384's extended description specifically mentions cases in
which an existing session is not invalidated. This submission zeroes
in specifically on the invalidation of sessions following a password
alteration, so it is clearly part of CWE-384.  The CWE Team believes
that this weakness should be a child of CWE-384.  Please indicate
if you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: Agree


----------


SUB.ACTCHANGE - "Change in action for submission"

Description: The submission's action needs to change, e.g., from "New
Entry" to "Modification," or vice versa. This potentially requires changes
to the kinds of information that will need to be provided.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Production stage until
the informational needs are addressed.

Comments: Considering the relationship with CWE-384, this CWE might
transition from a new entry to a modification of CWE-384. Due to other
submission problems we are unsure which action to take at this time.
Please indicate if you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: Agree


----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or full) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: Considering the positioning of CWE-384 and CWE-613 in
disparate sections of the subtree, it may be necessary for the CWE
Team to restructure the subtree or establish other ways that can
effectively encompass these session-related issues. Please indicate if
you agree or disagree with this comment.

Response: Agree

RESOLVED ISSUES:

----------

SUB.GRAMMAR - "Grammar/Spelling issues"

Description: The submission has multiple occurrences of errors with
grammar, spelling, etc. that should be fixed before publication.

Resolution: The submission will not be allowed to progress to later phases
if the grammar or spelling problems are so significant that they are likely
to cause difficulty for readers to understand the weakness. If the issues
are minor, then the submission could progress.	However, no submission can
be published without grammar and spelling checks. American English is used
for spelling.

Comments: The proposed description doesn't follow proper grammar and sentence
structure. Here is an updated change to consider. "After changing a password,
the active session should be invalidated. For instance, if a victim's
credentials are leaked and a malicious actor is using them, the victim may
change their password for increased protection. However, if the session is not
invalidated when the password is changed, the malicious actor can still exploit
the account because they are not automatically logged out." Please indicate if
you agree or disagree with the proposed change.

Response: [RESOLVED ISSUE; DO NOT CHANGE] Agree
