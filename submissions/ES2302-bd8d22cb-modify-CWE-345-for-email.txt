NAME: CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - emails and subscriptions

DESCRIPTION:

At this moment here https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html
searching for 'email' or 'subscription' phrase I can not see results. We
can add this content from me there as variants or examples: CWE-345 is
quite important technical weakness from emails point of view (some email
addresses can be recognized as PPI - with names and surnames). (1) During
registration steps if CWE-345 occurs, bad actor can register as another
person (using email which not own) - many scenarios, like real user can not
register in, because email is used, or bad actor can do a forbidden actions
there and get be banned - but in fact ban will be connected with victim's
email. (2) CWE-345 is also about action like subscriptions, when occurs
victims can get unwanted messages called spam. Proposed remediation:
verification link send to proper email - if real user want to get some
content it will be not a big deal to approve action, but thanks to this bad
actor will can not exploit CWE-345.

ACTIVE ISSUES:


SUB.OVERLAP - "Duplicate/Overlap"

Description: The submission identifies a weakness, but it is a duplicate of
(or partially overlaps) existing weaknesses, indicating problems with the
submission or associated CWE entries.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to later phases until (1) the
duplicate/overlap is understood and (2) it is clear how to resolve this
duplicate/overlap.

Comments: While this submission does not overlap an existing CWE entry, it does
overlap with an existing submission; ES2206-33c5627d - Account management with
insufficient verification of owner's external identifier(s).  This submission
can be viewed here
https://github.com/CWE-CAPEC/CWE-Content-Development-Repository/issues/23
(file: https://github.com/CWE-CAPEC/CWE-Content-Development-Repository/blob/main/submissions/ES2206-33c5627d-bad-account-creation-logic.txt), which has already moved to the Full Submission Requested phase.  The concept of
accepting subscriptions without verifying ownership of the email is not covered
in the overlapped submission and could be added as an additional example.
Please review the linked submission and let us know if you agree with the
overlap.

Response: Agree. Note - Please consider to use threats' examples
provided by me like impersonation (real user will can not register in,
malicious actor can make banned victim's account - email used in
registration process, or make flooding by unwanted messages).  From
business point of view - incorrect email addresses are useless and
from security point of view - possible threats.


----------

SUB.ABS.SUBTREE - "Potential subtree issue/gap"

Description: The submission might identify an issue for which there could
be a broader gap or organizational challenge that requires analysis of CWE
subtree relationships under Research View 1000, in ways that extend beyond
creation of a parent at the next-highest level of abstraction.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress past the consultation phase
(whether initial or full) unless it is at an acceptable level of
abstraction, and the subtree issue(s) can be resolved or addressed
independently.

Comments: While this submission references CWE-345, the weakness is more targeted
towards a proof of identity, which would fall under authentication, something
like CWE-287. Because this falls under access control, an area of CWE that
requires significant research and reorganization, there could be a subtree
issue/gap where this weakness would fit in better.  This will likely be resolved
once ES2206-33c5627d is resolved. Please let us know if you agree with the
analysis.

Response: Agree

----------

SUB.RELS - "Unclear relationships"

Description: The submission suggests some relationships, but the
name/description is not explained in a way in which the relationship is
relevant; or, the weakness is apparent, but it is not clear what the best
parent/child relationship(s) would be.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the next phase if SUB.UNCLEAR
is present. It can progress to other phases if the CWE Team agrees that the
potential relationships may require closer investigation.  The submission
cannot progress to the publication stage until clear relationships and
direct parents are identified. The CWE Team may decide to use high-level
relationships (e.g., to Pillars) if deeper problems such as SUB.ABS.SUBTREE
exist and cannot be quickly resolved.

Comments: Relationships remain unclear because SUB.ABS.SUBTREE is still active
and the relationships have not been identified for the overlapping submission
ES2206-33c5627d. This problem can be resolved in upcoming phases for
ES2206-33c5627d. Please acknowledge this problem.

Response: Agree


RESOLVED ISSUES:


SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If references still are not available, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception if no suitable reference is available.

Comments: While this weakness is easily understood, the submitter did not
provide any references to support the weakness or examples.  If you have any
references to provide they would be gladly accepted.
