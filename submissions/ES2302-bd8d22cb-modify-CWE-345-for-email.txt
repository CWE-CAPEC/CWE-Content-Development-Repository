NAME: CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - emails and subscriptions

DESCRIPTION:

At this moment here https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html
searching for 'email' or 'subscription' phrase I can not see results. We
can add this content from me there as variants or examples: CWE-345 is
quite important technical weakness from emails point of view (some email
addresses can be recognized as PPI - with names and surnames). (1) During
registration steps if CWE-345 occurs, bad actor can register as another
person (using email which not own) - many scenarios, like real user can not
register in, because email is used, or bad actor can do a forbidden actions
there and get be banned - but in fact ban will be connected with victim's
email. (2) CWE-345 is also about action like subscriptions, when occurs
victims can get unwanted messages called spam. Proposed remediation:
verification link send to proper email - if real user want to get some
content it will be not a big deal to approve action, but thanks to this bad
actor will can not exploit CWE-345.
