NAME: Insufficient protection of 2FA SMS Code

DESCRIPTION:

When 2FA SMS code is displayed at the beginning of the SMS message, quite
often it is possible to get to know code value without unblock device
action. That means, bad actor without knowing how to unblock victim device
can get to know this sensitive information, because it is displayed often
in 'bar' - shortcut/preview of message. Safer approach is to place this
code after part displayed message's shortcut. Example: victim leave a
mobile device in the room, because it is PIN or pattern protected and go
out for few minutes, bad actor from the same room can try exploit. Example:
'CODE Lorem ips--um' vs 'Lorem ipsum C--ODE' ; here "--" means ending of
visible part without unblocked device. Thanks to this real user who know
how to unblock device will get to know 2FA SMS code, but bad actor will can
not exploit this. This scenario assumes that bad actor is close to victim's
device - physicial part, but message form with 2FA Code is software part.
