NAME: Insufficient protection of 2FA SMS Code

DESCRIPTION:

When 2FA SMS code is displayed at the beginning of the SMS message, quite
often it is possible to get to know code value without unblock device
action. That means, bad actor without knowing how to unblock victim device
can get to know this sensitive information, because it is displayed often
in 'bar' - shortcut/preview of message. Safer approach is to place this
code after part displayed message's shortcut. Example: victim leave a
mobile device in the room, because it is PIN or pattern protected and go
out for few minutes, bad actor from the same room can try exploit. Example:
'CODE Lorem ips--um' vs 'Lorem ipsum C--ODE' ; here "--" means ending of
visible part without unblocked device. Thanks to this real user who know
how to unblock device will get to know 2FA SMS code, but bad actor will can
not exploit this. This scenario assumes that bad actor is close to victim's
device - physicial part, but message form with 2FA Code is software part.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.ABS.LOWLEVEL - "Low level of abstraction"

Description: The submission identifies an issue, but its abstraction might
be too low-level to merit its own CWE entry. If it is focused on a
particular technology, framework, protocol, or function, then it might not
be unique enough to get its own CWE ID.  This might lead to modification of
an existing entry to include the additional details, or creation of a
higher-level entry for which the submission is one example. (Note: some
older CWE entries have this problem and would not be published today,
generally because they were too specific to a particular language.)

Resolution: The submission will be allowed to progress to later phases once
the more-general concept is appropriately identified and described. The
original, lower-level submission will serve as a primary example of the
more general concept.

Comments: While the submission title broadly addresses the lack of 
protection for SMS codes, the description focuses narrowly on the issue 
of SMS codes being visible through message previews. This specific 
concern seems more relevant to end-users than developers, as users 
can choose to disable message previews on their devices to mitigate the risk.

From a developer's perspective, addressing this issue is challenging due 
to the inherent limitations of SMS technology, which treats all messages 
as plain text. In many cases, developers may not even have the option to 
switch the second factor from SMS to a more secure method, as SMS-based 
authentication might be the default or only available option provided 
by the application.

Given the narrow scope of the issue—limited to SMS—and the broader 
complexities surrounding it, this concern appears too low-level to 
warrant a new entry.

----------

SUB.RELREFS - "No relevant references"

Description: The submission does not provide relevant references that
explain the weakness, or the relevance is not easily found.

Resolution: The submission is not likely to progress to later phases if
there are no applicable, easily-accessible references. The submitter could
resolve by providing additional details such as a section name and quote
from the reference.  If no suitable references can be found, the CWE Team
may decide to make an exception.

Comments: The submission doesn't include any actual references. Please
provide valid reference(s) to justify the real-world example of the issue.

Response: <SUBMITTER SHOULD REPLY HERE>


----------

SUB.ACTION - "Unable to determine action"

Description: It is not clear what action to perform based on the
submission, e.g., create new entry, update existing entry, etc.

Resolution: The submission cannot progress to the Internal-Update stage
until the relevant actions(s) are identified.

Comments: Based on the other submission issues identified above, the CWE
team isn't clear on the next steps. We likely won't be able to accept
this submission.
