NAME: Add demox to CWE-77

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code foru00a0 php languageu00a0 for the given
description:

Demonstrative Examples:
````
<?php
$filename = $_GET['filename']; // User-controlled input
$cmd = "cat " . $filename;

system($cmd);
?>
````
This PHP code executes the cat command to display the contents of a file.
However, since user input ($filename) is directly appended to the command
without validation, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

For example, an attacker can send a request like:
`````
http://example.com/readfile.php?filename=/etc/passwd; ls

````

Which results in the executed command:
`````
cat /etc/passwd; ls
`````

This discloses the contents of /etc/passwd, which contains system user
information, and lists the files in the directory, potentially exposing
sensitive data.
