NAME: Add demox to CWE-77

DESCRIPTION:

I want to suggest the below code for php language for the given
description.

Demonstrative Examples:
````
<?php
$filename = $_GET['filename']; // User-controlled input
$cmd = "cat " . $filename;

system($cmd);
?>
````
This PHP code executes the cat command to display the contents of a file.
However, since user input ($filename) is directly appended to the command
without validation, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

For example, an attacker can send a request like:
`````
http://example.com/readfile.php?filename=/etc/passwd; ls

````

Which results in the executed command:
`````
cat /etc/passwd; ls
`````

This discloses the contents of /etc/passwd, which contains system user
information, and lists the files in the directory, potentially exposing
sensitive data.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SUB.MISC - "Miscellaneous/other problem"

Description: The submission has some other problem that is not covered
elsewhere.

Resolution: This will depend on the nature of the problem.

Comments: The proposed demonstrative example utilizes "system($cmd);", 
which is inherently tied to the operating system. As a result, this 
example aligns more closely with 
CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in an OS Command 
('OS Command Injection'). However, since CWE-78 already includes a similar 
PHP-based example, we cannot accept this submission for inclusion under 
that CWE. We encourage you to submit an alternative example for 
CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Command 
('Command Injection') that does not involve OS-specific commands. 
If no suitable alternative is provided, we will have to decline this submission.
